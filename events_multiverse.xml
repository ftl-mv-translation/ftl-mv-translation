	<text>"Years FIGHTING among the Lost Suns has made my hearing not what it USED to be. The rattling strike of BOMBS, the whistling winds of CHAOS! The screams of... of... of the innocent on the DAY OF TRAGEDY... The good Admiral, her sacrifice... GAH! Traveler, why do you BOTHER me?! Go, leave! You should not still be HERE!"</text>
	<text>"Let me give you a WARNING, traveler. If you hurt Thest or Corby, I will SQUISH your tiny HEAD like a grape between my PALMS. I tear off your LIMBS, feed them to the voracious BAT DOGS, and use your head as a BOWLING BALL. I will SPIT on your corpse, LAUGH at your funeral, and PISS on your grave. DO NOT MESS WITH ME, TRAVELER! DO YOU HEAR ME?! DO YOU HEAR ME!?! I'm sure you do. Now leave."</text>
	<text>"Your cluster is VIOLENT. Your cluster is CRUEL. Despite all the SIMILARITIES, I MISS my home, and I DREAD this place. I do not share Corby's OPTIMISM, but I will keep an... open mind. At the very least, you have MANY weapons. That Traveling Merchant... he is a VENDOR of death and destruction, but at least he is won over with a sizeable WALLET. Just like the ELDERS. Just like the FOREFATHERS. DAMN THEM ALL!"</text>
	<text>"Let me tell you a STORY, Traveler. In my cluster, once, there were FIVE Elders. Toarde, STONEWALL (what a foolish nickname), Rutha, Murvara, and Pretore. They were the WORST of autocrats, and they KILLED many. They killed my SISTER. But... I was lucky enough to meet the Good Admiral. With her help, we laid WASTE to the Theocracy. We PAVED over the Elders! Hahah! It was a brillant victory, and for some years, we found PEACE AND PROSPERITY. But nothing good can ever last. Do not become ATTACHED to your life, Traveler. It is fickle. It will fail."</text>
	<text>"The Good Admiral is ALIVE in this reality! It is TREMENDOUS news. Yet, the CREED does not allow me to visit her. It does not allow us to do ANYTHING. What is the point of COMING HERE, of all our grief, if we are BEHOLDEN to such TYRANNY? I despise it. But Thest says we MUST follow the creed. Thest knows BEST. EVEN I do not question this."</text>
	<text>"Faith gets you NOWHERE, Traveler. There is NOTHING to even have faith in. The truth is that the Multiverse HATES you. It HATES me. It wants us to suffer. And to THIS, I see only one response. I will LIGHT ABLAZE anything which attempts to DRAG me into the dirt. Faith, Hah! I have FAITH in myself and in my GUNS. NOTHING else. Certainly not you, and certainly not this CLUSTER."</text>
	<text>"They say the Good Admiral had a BROTHER. I have NEVER met him. I heard he hid, like a COWARD, when DEATH came for us ALL! I did not HIDE! I will HUNT DOWN this disgraceful Obadann, and I will THROTTLE him. If he is dead in my CLUSTER, then he will soon be DEAD in yours! If only the CREED would let me..."</text>
	<text>"The COUNCIL says I blabber too much. I blabber too much about the CREED. I blabber too much about the Good Admiral. I blabber too much about revenge. I blabber too much about... IT. The dreaded P-WORD of which I must not SPEAK! I do not care if I BLABBER! The Council thinks I am not QUALIFIED for this job. But Thest DEFENDS me. Thest is wise. He is all knowing. The Council FEARS him. HAH! You should FEAR Thest too, Traveler. At least as much as you should FEAR me."</text>
	<text>"You should ARM yourself, Traveler. You might think you are PREPARED, but you are not. Your cluster will need ALL THE MIGHT it can get. Why? I wish I could TELL YOU. But I MAY not. Nor would I if I could. Do not WORRY too much. In time, you will UNDERSTAND why we are here."</text>

	<text>처음에 당신은 이곳에 있던 함선이 평범한 반군 정비선이라고 생각했습니다. 하지만 그 짜증나는 엘레나의 뚜렸하면서도 고통스럽게 평범한 목소리를 듣고 생각이 바뀌었습니다. 아 엘레나가 아니라 레오였던가요? 아니지, 그건 남자 이름이지...</text>
	<text>"하하! 내가 죽은 줄로만 알았겠지! 하지만 난 절대 죽지 않아! 꺼져, 개년아!" 오 이런, 또 만나 버렸네요...</text>
	<text>"있잖아, 이제 너랑 그만 싸울래. 다 무의미한 짓이야." 레아는 잠시 가만히 있었습니다. "하하! 또라이! 너도 방금 네 표정을 봤어야 했는데! 하하하하! 이번엔 진짜로 니 엉덩일 걷어차 버릴 거다! 딱 대라, 개년아!"</text>
	<text>"난 아직도 프로스펙트 17에서의 대결을 잊지 못해! 산업용 채굴 빔을 정말 잘 사용하더군! 네가 내 왼쪽 검지를 작살냈을지는 몰라도, 이번엔 내가 네 면상을 갈아버릴 거야! 개년아!"</text>
	<text>"지휘부의 병신들은 자꾸 나보고 빔만 쓰지 말라고 하더군! 두 말할 필요도 없이 한심한 새끼들이지! 자.. 잠깐... 나 뭐 하고 있었지? 아, 맞아. 죽어! 개년아!"</text>
	<text>적함의 선장이 말하길 기다렸지만, 들려오는 건 목이 쉰 기침 소리 뿐이었습니다. "미.. 미안, 소릴 질러서 목이 아파. 속삭이면서 말해야겠어. 이번엔 널 꼭 잡고 말 테다, 개년아! 으겍! 목 아파..."</text>
	<text>당신의 눈앞으로 레아가 순간이동 해 왔습니다. 당신만큼이나 그녀도 놀란 것 같네요. "어? 미안한데, 배를 잘못탔네. 그냥 무시해." 레아는 자기 배로 돌아가 다시 한번 당신을 불렀습니다. "죽어! 개년아!"</text>
	<text>"하, 유라 성운에서 내가 널 거의 피떡이 될 때까지 쥐어팬건 기억나냐? 안난다고!? 그랬었어! 진짜로 그랬다고. 다 된 밥이었는데. 이번엔 정말 끝을 보자, 개년아!"</text>
	<text>"여, 잘 지냈냐! 내가 무슨 짓을 했는지 믿지 못할껄! 디스 랩을 썼어! 너에 대한 디스를 말이야! 내용이 어떻게 되냐면..." 당신은 기다렸지만, 랩은 시작되지 않았습니다. "그래, 가사를 까먹어 버렸어. 랩은 그냥 넘어가도록 하고, 이젠 뒤질 시간이야. 개년아!"</text>
	<text>"어흥! 하하, 놀랐냐? 이 장난은 캠프에서 일할 때도 항상 먹혔었지. 그 겁쟁이들은 겁먹지 않은 척 했었어, 지금 너처럼 말야! 어찌 됐건 간에 좆될 시간이다, 개년아!"</text>
	<text>"놀라지마, 내 지위가 상승하고 있어! 내 사령관은 어제부로 내게 일절 말을 걸지 않았지. 걔들이 날 얼마나 존경하는지 보여주는거라고! 너같은 벌레놈도 나한테 존중을 해줘야 해. 신의 공포를 느껴라 이 개년아!"</text>
	<text>"지금 더스크브링어 의사당에 주둔하고 있는 내 형제 카일은 그 폭발하는 괴짜 홀로그램들을 상대로도 입을 다물지 않아. 근데 너에 대한 이야기를 해주니까 바로 입을 닥치더라. 얼마나 좆같이 행동했길래 사람들이 더스크브링어보다 '너'를 더 싫어할 수 있지? 하, 좆까 개년아!"</text>
	<text>당신은 함선이 움직이길 기다렸지만 아무 일도 일어나지 않았습니다. 그때 갑자기, 레아가 잠에서 깨어났습니다. "어, 나 자는 거 못봤지? 그렇지? 다행이야, 내가 자는걸 들켰다면 정말 창피했을꺼라고. 잠깐만... 지금 싸울 시간이잖아 개년아!"</text>
	<text>"어딜 가나 네가 보이니 정말 지긋지긋해! 마치 날 따라다니는 거 같아... 소름 끼쳐!  내가 너무 쩔어서 나한테 매료된 광인, 그게 바로 너야. 근데 난 스토커를 좋아하지 않거든, 이 개년아!"</text>
	<!--NEW - 5.1-->
	<text>"이봐, 들어봐! 어느 날 내가 지적 욕구를 해소하기 위해 사전을 읽고 있었는데, 거기에 '배신자'가 있는걸 봤어. 설명을 보면 니 얼굴이 딱 그짝이라고 하더군! 사전이 그럴 정도면 니 면상이 얼마나 좆 같은걸까! 것보다 니가 더 병신같아 보이는점이 뭔지알아? 답은 니 면상에 새겨주지! 죽어라 개년아!"</text>
	<text>레아가 화면에 나타나 횡설수설하기 시작했습니다. 알아듣게 얘기하기까지 잠깐의 혼란스러움이 필요한가 봅니다. "내가 요즘 라니우스 언어를 연습하고 있거든! 라니우스 언어로 멍청이라고 말하는 70가지가 넘는 방법을 알고 있냐? 그리고 당연하게도! 넌 그 70단어 모두에 해당한다고, 개년아! 젠장! 어... 맞아, 싸울 시간이군. 개년아."</text>
	<text>레아가 평소처럼 장황하게 허튼소리를 늘어놓기 시작하자 당신은 집중력을 잃고 다른 생각을 하기 시작했습니다. '누가 자꾸 그녀를 보내는거지? 보낼 사람이 그렇게 없나?' 때때로 우주는 잔인한 유머 감각을 지니고 있죠. 아마 지금도 당신을 비웃고 있을 겁니다. 당신이 매번 그녀를 만날 때마다 비웃을 겁니다.</text>
	<text>레아가 이상한 체크무늬 모자를 쓰고 입에는 탐정 같아 보이는 파이프 담배를 문 채로 화면에 나타났습니다. "이 헤인즈라는 남자에 대한 글을 읽어 본 적이 있어. 꽤 멋진 사람이지. 민병대에서 탐정역할을 하는 사람이야. 멋지다는건 뭐, 그냥 해본 말이고. 그리고 어.. 이 멋져보이는 모자도 샀어. 어때보여? 아니지, 물어볼 필요 없겠다. 넌 패션 감각이라곤 요만큼도 없으니까. 싸움이나 하자고 개년아!"</text>
	<text>"야, 개년아! 쌰아아아앙녀여연. 썅. 개년. 개년. 아, 이런. 나 완전 꼴불견이었잖아. 어찌 됐건 네 상판때길 갈아버릴 시간이야, 개년아!"</text>
	<text>"문 열어라, [빔.맛.스.타] 나가신다! 삐이이임 당할 준비 됐냐! - 이거 어때? 개인 방송애서 쓸 새로운 인트로를 만들고 있는데. 난 이거 꽤 괜찮은 거 같아. 아, 방금 질문엔 대답 안 해줘도 되. 멋져 보이는 거 다 알거든. 이런, 서론이 너무 길었네. 이제 내 빔놀림을 쬐끔만 맛봐라!"</text>
	<text>"이봐 개년! 혹시 빔 타운에 가본 적 있어? 없다고? 정말 멋진 곳이니까 꼭 한번 가봐. 그게 어디 있냐면... 바로... 네 묘비 가장자리에 있지! 내가 곧 널 빔타운으로 보낼 거라고! 그게 어... 비유한거야. 넌 내 빔에 맞아 죽을 거고, 묘비는 사람이 묻힌 곳을 표시하잖아. 그러니까 어... 뭐 대충 이해했겠지?"</text>
	<text>당신은 레아가 그 불쾌한 파란색 머리카락을 평소보다 잛게 잘랐다는 걸 알아챘습니다. 몇 분 동안 서로가 어색한 눈빛으로 바라봤는데, 그녀는 당신이 자신의 머리카락에 대해 말을 꺼내도록 만들기 위해 이리저리 뒤척였습니다. 하지만 당신은 아무 말도 않았고, 그녀는 결국 패배의 한숨의 내쉬며 총을 들었습니다.</text>
	<text>"네가 꼰대짓을 하고 다닌다는 소문을 들었어! 그건 아주 나쁜 행동이라고 개년아! 꼰대짓을 해서는 안돼!" 당신이 어디서 그런 소문을 들었는지 추궁하자 그녀는 불편한 듯 몸을 이리저리 움직였습니다. "어... 어디서 들었더라? 내가 헛소문을 지어낸 건 아니라고! 어... 더이상 묻지 말고 닥쳐 개년아. 쏴버릴 꺼야!"</text>
	<text>화면에 나타난 레아가 이미지에 안맞게 우아하고 중후한 목소리로 말했습니다. "오호호, 반가워. 바로 나, 레아 애플버즈, 우주에서 가장 부유한 여인이야. 하하... 그래, 언젠간 그렇게 될 거라고! 하지만 그 전에 먼저 네 엉덩이를 걷어 차줘야겠어, 개년아!"</text>
	<text>"지난날에 내 형제가 말도 안되는 헛소리를 늘어놓더라. 날더러 계속 지기만 할거면 널 괴롭히는걸 그만두라 하더라고. 하, 좆까라그래! 난 널 영원히 쫓아다닐거야, 개년아! 앞으로 평생 날 보게 될테니 기대하라고!"</text>
	<text>"분명 네 부모는 널 부끄러워 할 거야! 아무도 널 사랑하지 않을 거고! 그리고 넌 매일 아침잠에서 깨어나며 오늘만큼은 누군가 반겨주기를 바라겠지! 하하! 병신!" 갑자기 레아가 울음을 터트렸습니다. 그녀는 터무니없을 정도로 심하게 흐느끼면서도 가까스로 자세를 유지한 채 선원들에게 공격을 명령했습니다.</text>
	<text>"오 그래 개년아, 다시 붙어볼 시간이라고! 지난번엔 거의 다 잡을 뻔했지만, 이번엔 꼭 박살내고 말겠다!" 당신은 레아의 말에 반론을 펼치고 싶었지만 말싸움해봐야 소용 없다는걸 알고 있습니다. 이제 싸울 시간입니다!</text>
	<text>"나는 실망스러운 존재가 아니야, 네가 실망스러운 존재겠지! 닥쳐! 나 너 싫어! 갸악!" 당신은 레아가 갑자기 왜 짜증을 내는지 알 수 없었지만 일일히 반응해줄 필요가 없다는 걸 알고 선제 공격하기로 결정했습니다."</text>

<!--MV REBELS-->
<textList name="TEXT_ENCOUNTER_MV_REBEL">
	<text>It appears you aren't alone! A fellow multiverse traveler, this time a Rebel, has already found their way to this beacon, and is moving in on your location.</text>
	<text>You were aware the Rebels had been finding their way into this sector, but you didn't expect to see a Multiverse-drive equipped vessel defending this beacon!</text>
	<text>It appears you aren't the only ship at this beacon, nor the only ship with a Multiverse-Drive here either! A hostile Multiverse Rebel ship has spotted you and is moving in to attack.</text>
	<text>"Haha! At last we have found you. It only took 768 different realities full of chocolate pudding or shape-shifting god aliens to find you here!" A beat up Multiverse Rebel ship moves in, weapons armed and ready.</text>
	<text>A confident Rebel captain of the nearby Multiverse ship boasts about his abilities at tracking you down, and swiftly gives his crew orders to attack. You figure you should do the same.</text>
	<text>The Rebel ship at this beacon looks like it has been through a lot... and for good reason! It's a ship from across the Multiverse, and it seems they've tracked you down to this beacon and are looking for a fight.</text>
	<text>The Rebels are a common sight all around the galaxy, but the ship here is no ordinary Rebel. They appear to be a Multiverse-Drive equipped vessel, and they've decided to engage you in combat!</text>
	<!--new batch! 3.11-->
	<text>"You're that Universe 0 bloke! Haha, we've got you now. You're one hard fellow to track down, but in the end, the Rebellion will always win!"</text>
	<text>A Rebel Multiverse ship approaches. "You son of a buzzard, do you know how many realities we had to suffer through until we found you? This is like, the 9th version of myself to pilot the 16th version of this ship! So quit running and just die!"</text>
	<text>You're amazed at the amounts of effort these Rebels go to tracking you down. A Rebel ship in poor condition bears down on you, determined not to let you past.</text>
	<!--new batch! 4.0-->
	<text>A mute Rebel officer fumbles, performing lazy sign language your translator slowly converts to verbal communication. "A Free Mantis ripped out my tongue. I blame you. Now I'm going to kill you."</text>
	<text>You receive a hail from an overweight Rebel. "I was an MFK Ace you know, but then I took a Bio-Beam to the knee. But if I can kill you... maybe Vance will give me another chance!" You suspect he's lying, but you don't have time to refute his claim.</text>
	<!--new batch! 4.10.3-->
	<text>The pastel blue hull of a Rebel MV vessel glides past. As soon as they spot you, they power up their weapons and engage!</text>
	<text>A Rebel ship comes screaming into the system... literally. The captain is shouting at the top of his lungs. Some of these Rebels are complete nuts; it looks like you'll have to crack another one.</text>
	<text>"Straight out of Universe 1, and the first thing I find is a Federation Renegade? My luck is never this good! Promotion, here I come..." Seems you'll have to prove this isn't quite the lucky encounter he's looking forward to.</text>
	<text>A Rebel captain appears on the vidscreen, chewing on a squirming bowl of young Orchids. "While tracking you down, we ran out of food. Now I'm stuck eating these gross baby things. Please, just let me kill you, so I can go find some food that doesn't cry when I bite it."</text>
	<text>A nearby Multiverse travelling Rebel ship broadcasts an automated message; "Glory to the Rebellion!" You remember the time when the Rebels cared enough to actually say it themselves. At least, you get to blow them up all the same.</text>
	<!--new batch! 5.1-->
	<text>Most of the Rebel forces sent from Universe 1 are ships like these. Strangely, you don't encounter many of them outside of random chance like this; you suppose the Rebellion keeps its Warp-Bays somewhere else. Regardless, a challenger is beckoning, and you aren't going to disappoint!</text>
	<text>You've heard Admiral Vance has some kind of personal grudge against Renegades, and so the Rebellion relies on its signature blue-clad MV Rebels to carry the burden of the invasion. You wonder how it feels to jump out of U1 just to face down a ship like yours. You're sure glad you don't.</text>
	<text>"I used to be a Fed during the Civil War in U1. But after the U0 invasion began... well... you either became a Rebel or you accepted your death or enslavement. If things had turned out differently... well... I hope you understand none of this is personal."</text>

	<text>You can't imagine what your kill count will be by the end of your mission, and frankly you aren't sure you want to find out. Still, there's nothing stopping you from salvaging these latest remains.</text>

	<text>"Ahhh crap crap crap! We surrender, stop firing for the love of Newton's Third Law!"</text>
	<text>The ship sends several images of a white flag to you. You figure that's a good sign that they wish to surrender.</text>
	<text>"Ok, we messed up. But if you kill us, well that's just not very cool man."</text>
	<text>"Look, this was a bit of a mistake. Let us go, and we promise we'll never make this mistake again. Probably."</text>
	<text>"I'm a fellow Renegade like you! Surely you understand we only wanted scrap! It was a mistake messing with you, take this and let us live!"</text>
	<text>The ship hails you, their captain soliciting a... favor for your 'pleasure' in turn for letting them live. When you express your disinterest, they offer something of more monetary value instead.</text>
	<text>The enemy hails you, speaking a mess of untranslated garble. "Apologies, I forgot to turn my translator on again." The captain pauses. "AAAAAAAAAAAAAH DON'T KILL US DON'T KILL US!"</text>
	<text>"Do you know who I am? If you kill me, my 37 wives will be absolutely devastated! Please spare me, for their sake! But also mostly mine!"</text>
	<text>"I have traveled thousands of realities and no ship has ever fared so well against me as you. You have earned the right to not be killed by me. Please stop." The enemy captain sounds triumphant, but you can see the fear in his eyes.</text>
	<text>"God, this is worse than the time we had to fight off an infestation of parasitic bat-worms! I can't believe I'm saying this, but we surrender!"</text>
	<text>"We will not surrender! Okay that's a lie, we surrender. I really don't want to die."</text>
	<text>"Ugh, I can't believe I've been brought to my knees by such an ugly bastard like you. Will you take our surrender, so my legend doesn't have to end in such a disappointing manner?"</text>
	<text>"I'm too pretty to die! Wait, maybe I can buy this stupid idiot off with some junk... wait, is my mic on?" The ship goes silent, followed by an offer of surrender.</text>
	<text>"Great, another scar for my face. I'd like to live past today, even if it means I'm going to be the mutilated amputee that you've left me as. Can I buy your mercy perhaps?"</text>

	<text>"A fellow Renegade? A true pleasure to meet you here, new friend! Now die."</text>
	<text>"Crap, this isn't the solid gold reality. Oh, there's a ship here. Men, get ready for battle!"</text>
	<text>"Where the hell are we? This is what we get for not using a warp-bay... wait, Federation? God damn it, we're in another one of those civil war realities. Looks like we're fighting our way out of this one!"</text>
	<text>A Multiverse ship jumps in a few seconds later, ready to pillage. There's no other option but to fight!</text>
	<text>"Bow down to me, foolish ship! This reality now belongs to us!" You doubt any ship could conquer an entire reality on their own, but regardless it's time for a fight!</text>
	<text>"Apologies stranger, it's really nothing personal that we have to kill you. Scrap's a hard commodity to come by! Well not really, but you can never have enough."</text>
	<text>"Don't even bother trying to run, Federation! Your ship is forfeit to me now! Hahahah!"</text>
	<text>From out of the tunnel comes a foreboding, yet strangely colored Renegade ship. It looks like talking it out isn't an option, because their guns are already firing!</text>
	<text>It's a common philosophy among Renegades that all scrap they can get their hands on belongs to them. You're guilty of this quite often as well, but now another Renegade has arrived and sees you as their next target!</text>
	<text>"Hello there, friend! I have a gift for you, would you like to see it?" You reluctantly ask what it is, only to be met by them charging forward in an offensive attack!</text>
	<text>"Haha, I am but 4 parallel universes ahead of you! But I will not have won until I've defeated you in EVERY universe! Yahoo!" The ship moves in to attack.</text>
	<!--new batch! 5.1-->
	<text>"You have to help me. No matter where I go, people keep calling me a Renegade. HOW DO THEY KNOW?! My name is Dan, I work in real estate, I just bought this ship to give it a test spin, and now everyone wants to kill me. And... and I want to kill everyone! Something's terribly wro-AGH! GIVE ME YOUR MONEY OR DIE!"</text>
	<text>"One Renegade to another, my luck's kinda gone to shit. I heard a rumor, a myth really... but when a Renegade dies, supposedly you wake up in another body and start all over again. Frankly, I'm kind of hoping you kill me. Who knows, maybe some day I'll wake up as you! Hahah! Heh..."</text>
	<text>"You'll never believe what I just came back from! I swear to god, there was this like, big place at the center of everything. There was a talking can of beans, and god himself, except he was a Slug with a big ring... and there was a guy in a maid outfit, and a guy with a card that smelled weird, and... and they were ALL SLUGS. I'M GOING INSANE!" The deranged Renegade raises his weapons, turning to violence in his madness.</text>
	<text>It's strange, seeing so many Renegades around nowadays. A long time ago, there only used to be a few; it certainly wasn't a popular title. But something about the adventure has drawn more people in. As the newcomer approaches you however, it seems one of your adventures is about to end.</text>
	<text>"Father, is that you?! Have you come back to me? You old coot, I hate you! Get out of my LIFE!" You have no idea what the Renegade on the other end is talking about, but whether they're your child or not, they're about to see the business end of your guns.</text>
