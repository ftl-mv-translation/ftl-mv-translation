	<text>You've arrived at the Spider Hive. The planet is appropriately spooky for what you're dealing with. In the skies, the Militia and Brood forces fight for control over the planet, but you're able to slip through the chaos and land on the surface near a giant cavern.</text>

			<text>You receive a distant hail from Montgomery, though it cuts in and out. "You made - delivery ship damaged - bombs are lost in cavern - need you - find them and - destroy the nest - Brood inside - careful!"</text>
			<choice hidden="true">
				<text>Enter the cavern.</text>
				<event>
					<text>You plunge into the darkness, guided only by the light from your own ship through empty labyrinths of bedrock. You pass by what appears to be the wreck of a Militia vessel, evidently the one carrying the bombs. You find them, fortunately, undamaged in the cargo and haul them back onto your ship.</text>
					<choice hidden="true">
						<text>If we don't detonate these, no one else can.</text>
						<event>
							<text>You keep on going, ever wary of the fact you could easily meet the same fate here as the first ship if you fail. Eventually the tunnels lead to what is presumably the center of the cavern, a massive near perfectly spherical room with walls lined with holes containing tens of thousands of eggs. There's no way this was the product of nature. This room was designed with intent.</text>
							<choice hidden="true">
								<text>Stealthily begin setting up the bombs.</text>
								<event>
									<text>Your crew rush to wire the bombs without waking up the spiders. From what you remember, these are the same design as the ones used against the Vek on Earth. Just one of those was capable of creating an explosion visible from space and caused massive earthquakes across the planet, so you can only imagine what kind of impact three of them will have. And you sure as hell don't want to stick around to see it.</text>
									<choice hidden="true">
										<text>Continue...</text>
										<event>
											<text>While wiring the third and final bomb, one of your crew trips and drops a metal plate from the bomb on the ground. At once, it seem as though every spider in the entire cavern lets out a cry. In a matter of seconds a massive roar silences them and a monstrous creature the size of three men erupts from the ground. This must be the queen, and she sure isn't happy. All 8 of her eyes lock onto you, but she doesn't attack. It almost seems as if she's giving you a warning.</text>
											<choice hidden="true">
												<text>Put down your laser.</text>
												<event>
													<text>It seems like suicide almost, but the last thing you want to risk is angering the spiders. From all you've seen so far, they seem more intelligent than the Militia is willing to admit and maybe, just maybe, you can make it out of here without anyone dying. The queen seems to notice this behavior and backs away from you. Around her several hatchlings cling to her legs, but they scatter when she turns and crawls though a hole in the hatchery walls. It almost seems as if she wants you to follow.</text>
													<choice hidden="true">
														<text>Follow her.</text>
														<event>
															<text>You crawl through the tunnel and find yourself now standing in a massive rectangular room with ships and lab equipment. You wipe away some of the dirt caked onto the walls and find underneath is rusted metal. This was a research center at some point, but judging from the smell, the staff are all dead. You see the queen walk over to a row of tubes on the walls, where you find many exotic creatures, some of which seem eerlily similar to the G.A.S., Vek, and other insectoid monstrosities used by the Brood. You glance over at a nearby desk where you find a letter addressed to, of all people, Oscar Wright. Next to it is a dongle containing blueprints for some kind of cruiser model, which you slip into your pocket.</text>

																	<text>"Dear Senator,
																	There has been a change of plans. Your methods for testing the insectoid DNA have deeply disturbed both me and the council. My team found a new candidate anyways. There will no longer be a need to continue your experiments. I would like to remind you that the only reason you are where you are today is because of your history with the Admiral, and in his absence the new leadership is not as generous. I am writing this only out of the best of intentions for your well being. If you don't want to wake up with a bullet in your head, I advise destroying all evidence at all costs.
																	
																	You know what you have to do, Oscar. Do not fail the Rebellion again.
																	Sincerely, Dr. E.W."</text>

																			<text>You aren't sure what to make of this, but you don't have much time. Montgomery calls out from behind you, ordering that you drop the letter. "Turn around slowly, captain. Put that paper down and come with me. We need to detonate the bombs and leave."</text>

That some stupid pirates could just breach the security of the Union's Coreworlds? No, but the Federation has been concerningly ignorant to the Senator's intentions. The Brood is real, yes, but they were nothing before this. We gave them the insectoids to release. We planted the Vek on Earth. It was an awful decision in hindsight, yes, and that's why we're here. The experiment was a failure. We cannot risk exposing the Senator's ties to the Rebellion. I'm afraid you're now a liability. But disposing of liabilities is what I'm best at."</text>

Once it finally subsides, Montgomery hails you one last time. "You saw nothing down there, understand?" You nod your head. "Good. You will be rewarded for your assistance, but I hope you understand that it would be a poor decision to speak of what was down there to anyone else."</text>

From a distance, you pull the trigger and the bombs detonate at once, creating a blinding flash of light that seems to engulf everything. And then, in an instant, the light subsides and nothing is left but a monumental crater in the face of the earth. The Brood forces, seeing their failure, jump away, and the Militia thanks you.

You make your way back to the ship and take off, rushing through the tunnels as the walls shake and the inferno behind you expands. In the end it comes down to almost a matter of seconds as you kick the engines into maximum thrust and take off from the planet.</text>

							<text>So many different questions are left running through your head. Why was the Rebellion testing the spiders and the Vek? What is the 'new candidate'? Who is Dr E.W.? You aren't sure if any of these questions will be answered, but you can't linger for too much longer. The queen, while safe, is obviously disturbed by the loss of her children. Had you not saved her, the entire species would have likely gone extinct. All you can do now is be glad another Ace is dead, and carry on with your mission. Maybe some day, whether it's you or another captain, someone will get to the bottom of this. You pull out the dongle from earlier and download the blueprint data onto your ship for later.</text>
