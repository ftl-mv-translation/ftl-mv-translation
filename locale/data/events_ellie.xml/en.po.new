Maybe we can talk this through. Your beef is with Wentworth, right? Or the divorce? I know - I represented your wife during that dispute.

You represent crooks and genocidal maniacs, and keep them out of hot water when they want to start race riots that provoke civil wars.\" Ellie lingers on that last thought, as if she wants to say more, but stops.

When his wife left him, and took his kid as well, he devoted himself to the role like crazy. He got acting tips from Cornelius Parrysmith, the most renowned method actor in the Multiverse, but he also started to... believe he WAS the character. I like the guy, but I also know he needs a friend. When he got fired, everything went downhill. I don't actually know why they sacked him, though I heard rumors it came all the way from the top. He practically single-handedly brought the company to fortune! I have a sinking feeling he won't stop until he's gotten 'Sammy'. Don't let him hurt Michael, okay? There's a lot of scumbags at W.I., but we actors are just trying to make a living.\" Gos nods and pats you on the back. \"Alright, that's all I had to say. I'll have my boys give you a little something on the way out. Always good to see someone protecting the Federation.\""

I built this whole damn show, and you just rode on my success. Acting tips from Cornelius Parrysmith? What a riot! The only person more insane than Cornelius I've ever met is YOU. You were a drugged up, smoke-addicted dumpster fire who couldn't act for shit. Why do you think your wife left you, huh? Because she couldn't stand to be around you. You're disgusting, you're worthless.\"\n"

They want to be entertained. Comedy's gotten darker. Kids have matured. The Civil War really changed this great nation, and for the better I say! The Union's ready to handle the truth, that this Multiverse is a dangerous place and they need to be ready to fight for their right to live here. Vance has the right idea. Those Rebels are out risking their lives to make things better for all of us, but until that happens we can't keep up with the goo-goo ga-ga fluff.\"\n"
"\n"
"Ellie shakes her head repeatedly. \"No no no, you're lying! You're a lying liar who lies! Children will always love me! I was fired because of a grand scheme orchestrated by Vance Wentworth! Don't lie to me!\"\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\n"
"\"I don't need to lie to you. You just need to stop pretending you're the main character in everyone else's life. Yeah, Vance was the one who ordered you to be fired. Because what kind of example were you setting for his nephew? After what you did to his sister? You wretch, he aught to have executed you for treating her that way. Instead, he just gave you the boot. It's well known you're a Fed-sympathizer anyways, and people like that aren't all too popular in these parts. Just consider yourself lucky you don't have lead lodged between your last remaining three brain-cells and get lost. Go find the dumpster you crawled out of and lock yourself in, for the benefit of everyone.\"\n"

"You sneak aboard the building where the event is being held, slipping through the back stages. Ellie moves with complete purpose, no galloping or horse noises. She stares forward laser focused, searching for one man and one man only. Eventually you reach the dressing rooms, where a couple cast members half-dressed in their costumes see you. \"Hey, hey, you people can't be back here! Fans aren't allowed backstage even with a pass until after the concert's over! Damn it, where's security...\"\n"
"Ellie spreads her arms and lets out a high pitched squeel. \"Dora! Cammie! You guys are here! It's me, Ellie! I don't need a pass silly, I'm the main character of the show. So forgetful.\" Ellie fakes a large sigh. \"But I'll forgive you both because today is a very exciting day! The day Ellie gets what she deserves!\"\n"
"The two mascots turn to each other. \"S-Stephan? Wh-wh-what are you d-doing? Holy shit, when we heard about Rigley... and Hueghey... Stephan- what is WRONG with you?! You're insane!\"\n"
"\t\t\t\n"
"\"Oh no, you guys too?! All around me, traitors, traitors, traitors! What's a horse to do? I'm so tired of this madness. The Multiverse has gone to crock. The only thing that can save it now is Ellie. Ellie and her best friend, superfan! Now. Get. Out. Of. My. Way.\" Ellie pushes her way past the mascots, who fall to the ground and don't even bother to get back up. You glance back at them before following Ellie into the room marked with a large blue \"S\". Inside, a tall but rather ordinary man sits in a padded chair facing a mirror, doing breathing exercises. He doesn't hear you come in, but when Ellie grabs him from behind and throws him to the floor, it gets his attention.\n"
"\"S-SECURI-MMPH\" Sammy is cut off by Ellie's boot in his mouth. \"Now now Sammy. Naughty little spider. I caaaauuuught you! Ellie caught you! Heheheh!\" Ellie sways her hands back and forth and does a little song and dance. Sammy struggles to escape from underneath Ellie but to no avail. However, clearly either someone heard his shouting earlier or the two mascots reported your crew, because you can hear shouting from outside and heavy footsteps. From the sound of it, there's quite a few guards on their way. You need to leave, and quickly."

"You make it safely outside the building and back to the ship, but not before a fully-suited woman jumps out in front of you to block you from getting to your ship, blaster in hand. She's a Rebel of some kind, but from her black and yellow uniform you can't quite tell what rank. Either way, not the kind of individual you'd expect to see here. \"So it's true! The deranged actor IS hunting down Flowers and Sunshine's cast members. When word reached Vance in Universe 1, well... there was quite a lot of hysteria! You have to imagine, after all your history... and to hear you're still out there! He thought you were dead, or in a loony bin somewhere at least. Unfortunately, you must understand Stephan, that Flowers and Sunshine is a member of the Wentworth Innovations family, and you aren't a part of that family. It's against business interests to leave you or your Renegade friends as liabilities. I was dispatched, hand chosen, from Universe 1 to make sure you STAY fired this time.\"\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\n"
"The Rebel turns to you. \"Vance sends his best regards, by the way. You're the one they sent to dismantle the Flagship? Really? Not who I would have chosen, but then again I have the intelligence to side with the liberators, not the oppressors. Now... I COULD kill you with my ship... but I think it'd be more entertaining for you to die to that big stupid looking blue spider. Hah.\" The cruiser from earlier powers on in the distance, its already out of place arsenal now humming with power. No more time to waste, it's time to fight!"

"Ellie draws her knife on you, demanding you pull the ship in closer. Not wanting to start another fight, you do as she says. To your shock, once you're close enough to the open roof of the stage, Ellie rushes for one of the airlocks and leaps out. She catches herself on one of the tarps, tearing it and swinging her way down to the stage. She hits the floor and rolls, and for a moment you think she might be dead from such a long fall. However, she gets up again with a limp and continues to approach Sammy, knife drawn. The crowd screams in terror, but their eyes are glued on the scene.\n"
"\t\t\t\n"
"\"ELLIE'S BACK! ELLIE'S BACK ON THE STAGE EVERYONE! CHEER FOR ME!\" Ellie spins around, stumbling because of her leg. She flicks her knife from out of her suit and points it directly at Sammy. \"Sammy the Spider, you're no hero of any child! You're a monster, teaching the youth the degenerate morals of an era of Rebel filth! You're a disgrace to everything this show has ever stood for! And to think, you fired me! You kicked Ellie the Equinoid OFF THE ELLIE THE EQUINOID SHOW! YOU LUNATIC!\"\n"

"\"SHUTTUP! SHUTTUP! YOU KNOW NOTHING! YOU- YOUR FAVORITE MUSIC IS RAP MUSIC! YOU HAVE NO TASTE!\"\n"
"\"Stephan, I don't even listen to rap music! Before this job I was just an Ellie imitator who worked gigs at carnivals and birthday parties! I was a nobody, and you were my hero! I remember watching you as a kid, you brought me so much joy! I-I drank quarp juice every day at recess! I still have my Ellie plushie from when I was a kid! I didn't fire you, I-I swear! I just got lucky, scoring a birthday gig for Vance's nephew! Ellie was his favorite character too! Vance thought I was good, but he didn't like the character! He told me he was planning to buy the studio, and add some new characters! He suggested I might do play a role well! I was so excited... I had no idea I was going to be REPLACING you! I thought I'd get to work alongside you!\"\n"
"Ellie stutters at the mention of Vance's nephew, but seems to shake it off. \"LIAR, LIAR! LIAR! DON'T GIVE ME THAT MALARKEY! NO NO NO! THERE IS ONLY ONE ELLIE! YOU CANNOT BE ELLIE!\" Ellie grabs Michael by the leg and with an impressive display of upper-body strength tosses him behind her. As Michael tries to get off the ground, Ellie plunges her knife into his shoulder, twisting it. Her smile grows wider and wider, as blood coats her uniform. \"ELLIE THE EQUINOID WILL ALWAYS BE THE GREATEST. CHARACTER. IN ALL OF MEDIA HISTORY! AND I. WILL ALWAYS. BE HER!\""

"With no time to waste, you call out to Ellie. Though your voice is mostly drowned out by all the screaming, it seems to reach Ellie regardless. She pauses, knife still in hand, and glances over at the crowd. Thousands of eyes stare down on her in terror, many of them children who used to revere her, or would have once if they had been old enough to watch her show in the past. Ellie falters, then glances back at Michael, whose whimpering has subsided and been replaced with quiet submission, ready for his fate.\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\n"
"\"Ellie... El... oh my god.\" Ellie stands up, and looks at her hands, soaked in a crimson red. \"What have I done? What have I become? Ellie... Ellie would never do this. Ellie doesn't... murder people. They were right. I'm insane. I'm wearing a bloody horse costume and I'm completely insane. How did I get here? HOW DID I GET HERE?\" Stephan begins to scream, collapsing to his knees and putting his hands on his head. \"WHAT HAVE I DONE?! ELENA? ELENA? OH MY GOD ELENA YOU WERE RIGHT! I BELONG IN AN ASYLUM... I... I belong in an asylum...\" Stephan falls to the floor, sobbing. \"I'm sorry Michael, I'm sorry... god what have I done?\"\n"
"Michael, still in shock, struggles to respond, but when he does it's in a strangely composed manner. \"You need to see a doctor. And you need to get as far away from Ellie and this show as you can. It's messing with you, man. This job made you go crazy. I think... I think I'm going to pass out.\" And so Sammy does, leaving Stephan all alone on the stage. \"Renegade.. I guess superfan isn't the right word... what do I do? What becomes of me? Michael's right... god how did I ever think I could come back from this.\" He tears off the gigantic horse head and throws it off the stage, revealing a messy tangle of grey hair and an aging man. He doesn't look menacing in even the slightest without the costume, just a sad old man with a broken life."
