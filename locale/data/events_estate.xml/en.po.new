"\"Our corporation was once hosted on Earth until the Rusting Hulks incident forced all corporations to relocate off-world. Pinnacle was soon caught up in a corporate (and personal) feud between Arcadia Research and Development and Wentworth Innovations regarding Pinnacle's controversial but highly successful sentient weapon project. In the pursuit of creating the advanced cognitive C.I.C.A. the two groups wished to study our highly advanced A.I. - the closest thing prior to C.I.C.A. to representing truly self-aware A.I.; Wentworth Innovations won the bidding race, but Arcadia won the contract, thanks to a deal between the CEOs. Even though CICA is now employed by Universe 1, Pinnacle continues to contribute to the Wentworth family and is a proud component in the ever evolving field of advanced robotics.\"\n"

"\t\t\tThe voice takes not a single pause nor break through its entire speech, and despite the proud statement at the end, you sense not a single measure of enthusiasm. It catches you as bizarrely robotic - but is that really to be unexpected?"
