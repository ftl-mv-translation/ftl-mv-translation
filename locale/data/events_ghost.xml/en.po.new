We took this colony a few weeks back in hopes of securing part of the Dynasty's Aether supply. It's gone wonderfully, except these damn Phantoms started teaming up. Now, the Dynasty's sending Vagabond hitmen to screw with us, hoping we'll leave before long. I sure as hell ain't losing to a species as inferior as this. Hmph. The Dynasty had its prime some eons ago, but now it's time for a new glorious empire. One run by Zoltans, but to make that happen first we need the kind of weapons this Aether will go towards making. Intel suggests a hidden fleet is waiting for a good chance to strike. Take out their leader and I'll compensate you.\""
