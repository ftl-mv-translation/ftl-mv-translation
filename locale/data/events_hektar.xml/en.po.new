Take your pick!\" Guntpunt swipes his spear at Metyunt, who leaps backwards as several Hektar employees shuffle forward and draw their guns in precaution, but Metyunt tells them to put their guns away.\n"

"\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMetyunt is left at a loss for words, but before he can find any, an explosion sends you all flying forward as one of the rioters accidentally sets off an explosive charge in one of the ships stored in the hangar. The Hektar officers watching spring into action and Metyunt follows behind them latching onto the one in charge and trying to stop him from giving the order to fire. The Slug grabs the lizard by the tail and flings Metyunt away, then orders the vessel above to open fire on the crowd. The lizards scatter as lasers pelt them from above. If you're going to get involved, now is the time to do so!"
