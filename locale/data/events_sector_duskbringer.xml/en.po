To me, I think I am both of those things, or perhaps even neither. I am a soldier who was turned bitter by war, and in my bitterness I let myself be betrayed by the Federation. I let the unjust actions of some few Union corporations and an underground Rebel insurrection channel, in all their efforts to bury the contributions of the Ministry to every major Federation War, take on the illusion as the actions of the entire Federation. I let myself be preyed upon by malicious, radical forces because they said they could change the galaxy and that's exactly what I wanted to hear. I wanted to believe the Duskbringers could solve all my problems. But they can't. The Duskbringers ARE the problem! As long as this Multiverse stands divided as it is, we will never be free of the Rebel plague or any other threat that might come over us. Fascism, nationalism, they're only pathways to decades of strife and death. How could a Federation that once stood so united in striking down the equally villainous Inquisitions now break apart so easily?\"\n"

"\t\t\t\t\tDevorak swings down his sword and aims it at one of the camera drones, which have now moved in closer and begun to circle him. \"To my Zoltan brethren, now is your chance to change the future. Should you call yourself a Duskbringer now, it is never too late to lay down your armor and your weapons, and abandon this terror. Should you be questioning your loyalty to the Federation or the Ministry, just think of what cause you would be giving up, just to become a mindless soldier to a group whose ideologies nearly mirror that of the so hated Rebellion! And should you still be a faithful Ministry or Federation ally, it is still your duty to ensure the everlastingness of this peace. For as long as those like the Duskbringers are at large in this galaxy, you and your peace will never truly be safe.\" Devorak bows, then stows his sword. Around him, many more Zoltans emerge from the shadows of the building behind you and yell various things against the Duskbringers. Even some dock workers and other civilians join in, and a few Duskbringer vessels from the fight above start to jump away."

"In the haze of the battle, you hadn't quite realized that several broadcasting drones had gathered around the city observing you, and some reporters are even on scene. Devorak seems to realize this too, and he rushes over to the wreckage and emerges several minutes later with a struggling body. It's Jack, badly injured, who Devorak flops on the ground and pulls the helmet off. He holds it high in the air for the cameras to see.\n"

"\t\t\t\"For years the Duskbringers have petitioned that the Federation has grown weak and useless in its prime age, and have argued the Ministry should divorce itself from the alliance and become a new, all encompassing empire! Yet, in all of these years never once have the Duskbringers been able to truly justify their hatred to the Federation! It is true, the Federation is imperfect, and is composite of imperfect governments run by imperfect people. Yet it stands to represent one universal dream - true, galactic, or even Multiversal, peace. The Duskbringers don't want this peace, and so in their desperation they've found one final effort. Hiring mercenaries, pirate scum who make this galaxy an even more dangerous and villainous place, to stage a Federation assault on a peaceful Ministry trading port! Are these the actions of self professed heroes? People willing to die for their nation and the good of the galaxy? Or is it the work of a group of terrorists trying to seize power at the cost of perhaps the one and only hope we have left of achieving unity in this Multiverse?\""
