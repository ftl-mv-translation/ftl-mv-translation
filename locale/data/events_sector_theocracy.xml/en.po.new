"The Rockmen are mildly confused that a Federation ship is offering to help, "

"Yesterday, CMO Rig Bramston arranged a meeting on these premises to discuss "
"a solution to his... medical issues. Seven years ago, he was in a company "
"meeting alongside a Zoltan envoy named Tintan, when a Slug vessel arrived "
"and deployed a 'prank' on the meeting, melding the two into one being "
"against their will. As you can understand, reversing this has been a top "
"priority for both Rig and Zulfiqar for the past seven years, but nothing we "
"have attempted since has worked, and Rig's vitals - or rather, Tintan's, are"
" showing signs that she is growing dangerously unstable over time, and may "
"be at risk of detonation. As you might imagine, we are now in quite the "
"dilemma and need to operate immediately.\""
