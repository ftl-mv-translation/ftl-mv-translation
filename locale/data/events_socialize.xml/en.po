Pretty little Ellie lingered in my thoughts every day, every moment of my life. It sat there, brewing, just long enough that one day it just... came to me. 'Ellie the Equinoid'! I just... shouted it. Heh. Paul was startled by the outburst, but it didn't take any convincing. It was a perfect name, and it stuck.

Within a week the former king had been chasssed into exile and Mr. Invincccible was on top of it all. He wasss king! And it wassss terrible. There was no adventure.

"In the breakroom, A55 rolls up to Jerry with a cacaphony of metallic thuds while Jerry is trying to figure out a rather complicated crossword. \"Arg, shy but kind blonde kid! Yer uncle was er... Admiral Vance Wentworth, right?\" Jerry nods. \"Yeah, he was, uh... pirate... robot?\"\n"
"\t\n"
"\"Arrrr. So, if you's was kin'n blood of the admiral, and I was say... the brain child of one close colleague of his. That's makes us cousins, don't it? Yeah? Ain't that right matey?\" A55 sticks out his non-buzzsaw hand to Jerry. \"Well, mister... do you prefer I spell out 'a-5-5' or do you want me to call you 'asshole'?\" A55 shrugs. \"You can call me either, cousin. Family's more than just names!\"\n"
"\t\n"
"Jerry nods. \"Well, Captain A55. What you just said doesn't... make much sense at all.\" A55 frowns. \"Oh... I see laddy. I'm sorry. I just... well I have no family. I had a pirate crew! But they're in the past now.\" Jerry stops the drone. \"BUT - if it'll make you happy, we can still be cousins. Or brothers. Or whatever. Family is more than just blood too.\" Jerry shakes A55's hand and the two go to work on the crossword together."
