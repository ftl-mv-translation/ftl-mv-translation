Rigley clutches his hand and continues to scream, falling onto his side and rolling around on the floor. Ellie breathes a deep sigh and pockets her knife. \"Good times they were, Rigley! Next time, think a bit before you decide the good times have to STOP, okay? Bye bye!\" Ellie grabs a form from his desk and cheerfully waves, then gallops out of the room.\n"
"\t\t\t\n"
"You take one last look at the pathetic man on the floor and half-heartedly remind him he'll be able to afford a good artificial replacement for his hand later, and to apply pressure to the wound. Rigley doesn't hear you, and you turn and leave the room as well."

Hueghey screams but can only just be heard over Ellie's maniac laughter. \"STEPHAN! STOP!

You represent crooks and genocidal maniacs, and keep them out of hot water when they want to start race riots that provoke civil wars.\" Ellie lingers on that last thought, as if she wants to say more, but stops.

He's certainly nowhere as dedicated to the role as you are, but you can't blame him for a decision made all the way up the ladder to W.I. when they bought the studio!\"\n"
"Ellie begins to scream and shout, kicking over tables and tearing up some paintings on the wall.

You... you'd never betray your best friend Ellie! Remmy and Ellie, they're the most iconic duo in media history!\"\n"
"Gos nods carefully. \"Just like old times, yeah? I know the divorce hit you hard Stephan, and getting fired even more, but you can't make it alone in this screwed up Multiverse. I can try my best to help you, but in the end you have to help yourself first.\"\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"
"Ellie shakes her head. \"Ellie IS helping herself! She's on the right path, don't you worry best friend! Okay, well I have to go now, space is big and there's a lot of children out there who need Ellie! Bye bye! Let's go, superfan!\" Ellie gallops out the door and back to the ship.\n"
"\n"
"You go to follow but Gos puts a hand on your shoulder to stop you. \"Hey, thanks for that. Just... keep an eye on him, okay? He's always been a bit... well I'm not sure how to put it politely. A bit loopy, I guess. Back when he joined Flowers and Sunshine, the company was in the dirt, and Stephan was nothing but a deadbeat actor who had fallen from grace. When his wife left him, and took his kid as well, he devoted himself to the role like crazy. He got acting tips from Cornelius Parrysmith, the most renowned method actor in the Multiverse, but he also started to... believe he WAS the character. I like the guy, but I also know he needs a friend. When he got fired, everything went downhill. I don't actually know why they sacked him, though I heard rumors it came all the way from the top. He practically single-handedly brought the company to fortune! I have a sinking feeling he won't stop until he's gotten 'Sammy'. Don't let him hurt Michael, okay? There's a lot of scumbags at W.I., but we actors are just trying to make a living.\" Gos nods and pats you on the back. \"Alright, that's all I had to say. I'll have my boys give you a little something on the way out. Always good to see someone protecting the Federation.\""

"Paul breaks out into full on laughter, curling into a ball in pain from how much he's laughing. \"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH! JEALOUS?! OF YOU?!\" Paul scoots closer, his smug smile receding and replaced by a menacing look. \"I gave you a chance to climb up from the ground, you psycopathic lunatic. I built this whole damn show, and you just rode on my success. Acting tips from Cornelius Parrysmith? What a riot! The only person more insane than Cornelius I've ever met is YOU. You were a drugged up, smoke-addicted dumpster fire who couldn't act for shit. Why do you think your wife left you, huh? Because she couldn't stand to be around you. You're disgusting, you're worthless.\"\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\n"
"Ellie slams her knife into the desk in front of her, leaning in closer. \"I AM NOT WORTHLESS! I AM BELOVED, I AM FABULOUS, I AM THE GREATEST CHARACTER IN ALL OF MEDIA HISTORY!\"\n"
"\n"
"Paul snorts. \"No, you're just delusional. Ellie's ratings were tanking long before you were fired. Kids got tired of the gimmick. They don't want wholesome, happy bullshit. They don't want morals. They want to be entertained. Comedy's gotten darker. Kids have matured. The Civil War really changed this great nation, and for the better I say! The Union's ready to handle the truth, that this Multiverse is a dangerous place and they need to be ready to fight for their right to live here. Vance has the right idea. Those Rebels are out risking their lives to make things better for all of us, but until that happens we can't keep up with the goo-goo ga-ga fluff.\"\n"
"\n"
"Ellie shakes her head repeatedly. \"No no no, you're lying! You're a lying liar who lies! Children will always love me! I was fired because of a grand scheme orchestrated by Vance Wentworth! Don't lie to me!\"\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\n"
"\"I don't need to lie to you. You just need to stop pretending you're the main character in everyone else's life. Yeah, Vance was the one who ordered you to be fired. Because what kind of example were you setting for his nephew? After what you did to his sister? You wretch, he ought to have executed you for treating her that way. Instead, he just gave you the boot. It's well known you're a Fed-sympathizer anyways, and people like that aren't all too popular in these parts. Just consider yourself lucky you don't have lead lodged between your last remaining three brain-cells and get lost. Go find the dumpster you crawled out of and lock yourself in, for the benefit of everyone.\"\n"
"\n"
"Ellie lunges for Paul, grabbing him by the throat and pulling him onto the ground. She begins maniacally beating him with her fists, but the man makes not even so much as a whimper as he's assaulted. It seems he's accepted his own fate, and doesn't even care. The question is, what benefit will this bring?"

"You sneak aboard the building where the event is being held, slipping through the back stages. Ellie moves with complete purpose, no galloping or horse noises. She stares forward laser focused, searching for one man and one man only. Eventually you reach the dressing rooms, where a couple cast members half-dressed in their costumes see you. \"Hey, hey, you people can't be back here! Fans aren't allowed backstage even with a pass until after the concert's over! Damn it, where's security...\"\n"
"Ellie spreads her arms and lets out a high pitched squeal. \"Dora! Cammie! You guys are here! It's me, Ellie! I don't need a pass, silly, I'm the main character of the show. So forgetful.\" Ellie fakes a large sigh. \"But I'll forgive you both because today is a very exciting day! The day Ellie gets what she deserves!\"\n"
"The two mascots turn to each other. \"S-Stephan? Wh-wh-what are you d-doing? Holy shit, when we heard about Rigley... and Hueghey... Stephan- what is WRONG with you?! You're insane!\"\n"
"\t\t\t\n"
"\"Oh no, you guys too?! All around me, traitors, traitors, traitors! What's a horse to do? I'm so tired of this madness. The Multiverse has gone to crock. The only thing that can save it now is Ellie. Ellie and her best friend, superfan! Now. Get. Out. Of. My. Way.\" Ellie pushes her way past the mascots, who fall to the ground and don't even bother to get back up. You glance back at them before following Ellie into the room marked with a large blue \"S\". Inside, a tall but rather ordinary man sits in a padded chair facing a mirror, doing breathing exercises. He doesn't hear you come in, but when Ellie grabs him from behind and throws him to the floor, it gets his attention.\n"
"\"S-SECURI-MMPH\" Sammy is cut off by Ellie's boot in his mouth. \"Now now Sammy. Naughty little spider. I caaaauuuught you! Ellie caught you! Heheheh!\" Ellie sways her hands back and forth and does a little song and dance. Sammy struggles to escape from underneath Ellie but to no avail. However, clearly either someone heard his shouting earlier or the two mascots reported your crew, because you can hear shouting from outside and heavy footsteps. From the sound of it, there's quite a few guards on their way. You need to leave, and quickly."

"You make it safely outside the building and back to the ship, but not before a fully-suited woman jumps out in front of you to block you from getting to your ship, blaster in hand. She's a Rebel of some kind, but from her black and yellow uniform you can't quite tell what rank. Either way, not the kind of individual you'd expect to see here. \"So it's true! The deranged actor IS hunting down Flowers and Sunshine's cast members. When word reached Vance in Universe 1, well... there was quite a lot of hysteria! You have to imagine, after all your history... and to hear you're still out there! He thought you were dead, or in a loony bin somewhere at least. Unfortunately, you must understand Stephan, that Flowers and Sunshine is a member of the Wentworth Innovations family, and you aren't a part of that family. It's against business interests to leave you or your Renegade friends as liabilities. I was dispatched, hand chosen, from Universe 1 to make sure you STAY fired this time.\"\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\n"
"The Rebel turns to you. \"Vance sends his best regards, by the way. You're the one they sent to dismantle the Flagship? Really? Not who I would have chosen, but then again I have the intelligence to side with the liberators, not the oppressors. Now... I COULD kill you with my ship... but I think it'd be more entertaining for you to die to that big stupid looking blue spider. Hah.\" The cruiser from earlier powers on in the distance, its already out of place arsenal now humming with power. No more time to waste, it's time to fight!"

She catches herself on one of the tarps, tearing it and swinging her way down to the stage. She hits the floor and rolls, and for a moment you think she might be dead from such a long fall. However, she gets up again with a limp and continues to approach Sammy, knife drawn. The crowd screams in terror, but their eyes are glued on the scene.\n"
"\t\t\t\n"
"\"ELLIE'S BACK! ELLIE'S BACK ON THE STAGE EVERYONE! CHEER FOR ME!\" Ellie spins around, stumbling because of her leg. She flicks her knife from out of her suit and points it directly at Sammy. \"Sammy the Spider, you're no hero of any child! You're a monster, teaching the youth the degenerate morals of an era of Rebel filth! You're a disgrace to everything this show has ever stood for! And to think, you fired me! You kicked Ellie the Equinoid OFF THE ELLIE THE EQUINOID SHOW! YOU LUNATIC!\"\n"

"\"SHUTTUP! SHUTTUP! YOU KNOW NOTHING! YOU- YOUR FAVORITE MUSIC IS RAP MUSIC! YOU HAVE NO TASTE!\"\n"
"\"Stephan, I don't even listen to rap music! Before this job I was just an Ellie imitator who worked gigs at carnivals and birthday parties! I was a nobody, and you were my hero! I remember watching you as a kid, you brought me so much joy! I-I drank quarp juice every day at recess! I still have my Ellie plushie from when I was a kid! I didn't fire you, I-I swear! I just got lucky, scoring a birthday gig for Vance's nephew! Ellie was his favorite character too! Vance thought I was good, but he didn't like the character! He told me he was planning to buy the studio, and add some new characters! He suggested I might play a role well! I was so excited... I had no idea I was going to be REPLACING you! I thought I'd get to work alongside you!\"\n"
"Ellie stutters at the mention of Vance's nephew, but seems to shake it off. \"LIAR, LIAR! LIAR! DON'T GIVE ME THAT MALARKEY! NO NO NO! THERE IS ONLY ONE ELLIE! YOU CANNOT BE ELLIE!\" Ellie grabs Michael by the leg and with an impressive display of upper-body strength tosses him behind her. As Michael tries to get off the ground, Ellie plunges her knife into his shoulder, twisting it. Her smile grows wider and wider, as blood coats her uniform. \"ELLIE THE EQUINOID WILL ALWAYS BE THE GREATEST. CHARACTER. IN ALL OF MEDIA HISTORY! AND I. WILL ALWAYS. BE HER!\""

Thousands of eyes stare down on her in terror, many of them children who used to revere her, or would have once if they had been old enough to watch her show in the past. Ellie falters, then glances back at Michael, whose whimpering has subsided and been replaced with quiet submission, ready for his fate.\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\n"
"\"Ellie... El... oh my god.\" Ellie stands up, and looks at her hands, soaked in a crimson red. \"What have I done? What have I become? Ellie... Ellie would never do this. Ellie doesn't... murder people. They were right. I'm insane. I'm wearing a bloody horse costume and I'm completely insane. How did I get here? HOW DID I GET HERE?\" Stephan begins to scream, collapsing to his knees and putting his hands on his head. \"WHAT HAVE I DONE?! ELENA? ELENA? OH MY GOD ELENA YOU WERE RIGHT! I BELONG IN AN ASYLUM... I... I belong in an asylum...\" Stephan falls to the floor, sobbing. \"I'm sorry Michael, I'm sorry... god what have I done?\"\n"
"Michael, still in shock, struggles to respond, but when he does it's in a strangely composed manner. \"You need to see a doctor. And you need to get as far away from Ellie and this show as you can. It's messing with you, man. This job made you go crazy. I think... I think I'm going to pass out.\" And so Michael does, leaving Stephan all alone on the stage. \"Renegade.. I guess superfan isn't the right word... what do I do? What becomes of me? Michael's right... god how did I ever think I could come back from this.\" He tears off the gigantic horse head and throws it off the stage, revealing a messy tangle of grey hair and an aging man. He doesn't look menacing in even the slightest without the costume, just a sad old man with a broken life."
