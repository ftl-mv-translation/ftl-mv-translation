Pretty little Ellie lingered in my thoughts every day, every moment of my life. It sat there, brewing, just long enough that one day it just... came to me. 'Ellie the Equinoid'! I just... shouted it. Heh. Paul was startled by the outburst, but it didn't take any convincing. It was a perfect name, and it stuck.

"\"Yes, I am her, and she is me. You are... the Lost Sun Admiral. I apologize if I forgot your name.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Ariadne.\" Ariadne announces her name with a piercing effect, making sure Dianesh never forgets it. The air between them is tense, although not necessarily hostile.\n"
"\n"
"\"So, have you come here to tell me I am another corrupt, evil autocrat who's rule must be expunged from the face of existence like the Elders? If that is your intent, then I advise you just cut to the chase and say it.\"\n"
"\n"
"Ariadne shakes her head. \"On the contrary. I came to say I have a lot of respect for you, girl, both personally and in your leadership. I'm a revolutionary, but I'm not a radical. I know you were born into this, you didn't seize this power yourself. From what I can tell you seem to be doing a good job. I know you have your people's wellbeing in your heart and mind at all times, and that's ultimately what matters most in a leader.\"\n"
"\t\n"
"Dianesh nods, although a bit confused. \"Uhuh... Well I am pleasantly surprised to hear that then. Your men haven't been the most... polite to mine, with all that feuding between the Suns and the SSLG. But really, I assure you, my intent is not just to extend my power. If you want a Rock democracy, by all means you can have it. We are two distinct species now, and I have no delusions about it. But I do think there are many benefits to a renewed sistership between us. One where we are equals, and not the basis of a religion.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Good. I'm not a fan of imperialism, but I'm sure we can make something work. But if you double cross me, I will-\" Dianesh cuts her off. \"You will what, crush my head with your own bare hands? No need to finish that sentence, because I was only going to tell you the same.\" The two women smile at this mutual understanding and shake hands."

And who could blame him? The god damn 'election' cycle involvessss a bunch of moronssss racing to sssteal sssome sssstupid ssshitty crown. It'sss a mockery, but it'sss a sssacred tradition. A compromissse invented after the fall of the Clairvoyant Empire over a century ago. And when he got that crown it felt like the galaxy wassss falling apart. Within a week the former king had been chasssed into exile and Mr. Invincible was on top of it all. He wasss king! And it wassss terrible. There was no adventure.
