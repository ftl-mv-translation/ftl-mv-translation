After downloading, place the file in the mods folder in the SMM folder.

Run `modman.exe` or `modman.jar`, then check the checkbox of the mod you want to install. The mod order is very important.

The mod order should be:
```
| Translated MV(This mod)
|
| Any other MV addon(optional)
v
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Do NOT patch the original MV assets and data with this translated one. We bundle translated assets and data into one file, so you only need to patch this file (or this file with addons) to play MV.

Run FTL and select your language in options. Now you can play MV in your mother tongue!
