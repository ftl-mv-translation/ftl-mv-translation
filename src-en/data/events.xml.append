<event name="TUTORIAL_1">
	<text>[PART 1: OVERVIEW]
	While FTL: Multiverse's core gameplay resembles vanilla, the balance and ecosystem are very different. Keep an eye out for familiar vanilla equipment, as it may function differently from how you remember.
	Nearly every face of the game has been retooled in some way, either minorly or significantly, but here are some core changes to keep in mind when transitioning from vanilla.
	
	---EXTENSIVE WEAPON REBALANCING---
	Most weapons in MV are rebalanced to be viable and worthwhile to use. Weak or unviable/niche playstyles in vanilla such as weapon crew kills, missile builds, drone builds, etc have been both buffed in terms of equipment and in terms of additional items available to allow more experimentation. Don't rule anything out because you didn't like it in vanilla - you may find it much stronger in MV!
	
	---REWORKED UNIQUE SECTORS---
	Vanilla 'Homeworld' Sectors have now been reworked into completely new and extensive sectors of their own, with unique events and lore you won't find in generic versions of the sectors. Some can have multiple unlocks as well, and you can identify unique sectors on the map by the [!] in their name.
	Keep an eye on the new colored divisions in the sector map - these represent 'zones'. By the time you reach the yellow zone in sectors 6/7, you'll only find unique sectors!
	
	--REWORKED STORES--
	Stores now serve as their own special events. On the map, you'll see labels next to stores denoting which faction owns them, as well as a color signifying if they're peaceful, neutral, or hostile. Not every interaction will lead to the store menu, so make sure you pay attention and in the case of hostile stores keep the corresponding crew on-hand.
	The store menu itself is also different. Weapons will always spawn in every store you find, and systems have been split into two sections. "Essential Systems" will always spawn, while "Auxiliary Systems" only appear sometimes.
	
	
	Generally, MV is designed to be a lot more consistent with harder optional boss fights and elite encounters. Paying attention to events and dialogue will help you get a firm grasp on the lore and help you succeed!</text>

<event name="TUTORIAL_2">
	<text>[PART 2: CREW]
	Crew mechanics have been greatly expanded in FTL: Multiverse, including new crew types. Understanding the difference between them can be important in balancing out your crew.
	
	---SUBTYPES---
	Besides new species, most races also have variations called 'subtypes' which have different abilities, stats, and visual appearances. Some examples are Human Medics, Zoltan Monks, and Rock Outcasts. Subtypes usually have a distinct color or outfit to set them apart from their regular variants, so whenever you get new crew make sure you check their stats.
	
	---ELITES---
	Some subtypes are special elite versions of crew, which are extra strong but much harder to obtain.</text>
