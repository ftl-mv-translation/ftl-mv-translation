	<text>Part 1 out of 10... Introduction!
	Welcome to Multiverse! Since you're playing the tutorial, it's safe to assume you're new to the mod! Multiverse functions as a sort of sequel to vanilla. If you want to learn more about the general lore, on your next run give Casual or Normal mode a try, and select the "Go over your mission details one last time" option.</text>
	<choice hidden="true">
		<text>Continue...</text>
		<event>
			<text>Multiverse is a massive expansion mod for FTL, and as such has a lot of content. While this tutorial cannot possibly cover all of it, it'll try to cover some of the more important information to help ease you into the mod.
			This introduction will cover some of the factions you'll find... if you want to skip this part so you can discover them for yourself, click the skip button and continue to the next beacon!</text>
			<choice hidden="true">
				<text>Learn about the factions.</text>
				<event>
					<text>Here are some good to know things about the new friendly factions you'll find:	
					Orchid Gathering - A usually peaceful faction of plant beings. Due to the oxygen producing abilities of their crew, killing their ships through asphyxiation is very hard, but not impossible. Orchids also will often (but not always) use powerful missile-like weapons called Kernels that guaruntee a breach but still use ammunition.
					Free Mantis - A hyper-friendly but somewhat dimmwitted sect of Mantis rogues. They have very powerful boarding ships, but will usually only attack when they percieve your actions as hostile. Beyond that, they will likely be very happy to see you.
					The Militia - The militia is a band of civilian volunteers who protect civilian space. As they are a sub-group of the Galactic Union, a member of the Federation alliance, they should only bother you if you break the law in their presence.
					Shell Geniocracy - The Shells usually keep to the nebulas and place a heavy value on science. They have a heavy dependance on oxygen but their ships will usually have a very strong set of defenses.</text>
					<choice hidden="true">
						<text>Continue...</text>
						<event>
							<text>Here are some good to know things about the new neutral factions you'll find:
							Separatists - The Separatists are a division of Engi who have broken free from the unifying Harmony that controls the majority of their population. While they've had issues with the Federation in the past, they usually like to keep to themselves, sometimes to such an extreme their ships only have 1 or 2 crew aboard!
							Lost Suns - Though technically allied with the Federation, the Lost Suns are an aggressive and radical group of fire obsessed Rockmen currently engaging in a violent civil war with the authoritarian Rockmen Elders.
							The Ghosts - The Ghosts aren't actual paranormal entities, but are rather made mostly of the same gaseous substance as the nebulas they usually reside in. The Ghosts take little to no interest in politics, usually preferring to just live aboard the wrecks of abandoned vessels.
							Exotic Hunters Guild - The EHG is a group of Slug hobbyists and hunters who like to hunt a special kind of game... the sapient kind. All the same, they're usually welcoming to tourists of all species and hold no special ill-will to the Federation.</text>
							<choice hidden="true">
								<text>Continue...</text>
								<event>
									<text>Here are some good to know things about the new hostile factions you'll find:
									The Coalition - An extremely violent and unstable alliance between the Rock Theocracy, Slug Kleptocracy, Mantis Hive, and Crystalline Empire, and employs a wide range of tactics usually seen on the standard ships of all 4 races.
									Duskbringers - A Zoltan terrorist group that has received an alarming amount of support from Zoltan citizens. The Duskbringers rely on suicide tactics in combat, but can be manipulated into using their explosive abilities at unfortunate times (for them).
									Rebel Engineers - A subset of the Rebel fleet that maintains the automated ships of the Rebellion. Generally have better armed and higher tech ships overall, but are much less common and not always loyal to their employers.</text>
									<choice hidden="true">
										<text>Continue...</text>
										<event>
											<text>And of course, all of the vanilla factions you know return as well, such as the Engi Harmony, Zoltan Ministry, Slug Kleptocracy, Rock Theocracy, Mantis Hive, Crystalline Empire, Lanius Swarm, and of course the Federation and Rebellion. On your travels you might also bump in other secretive factions not listed here, so always be on the look-out!
											
											This concludes part 1. Continue to the next beacon to proceed with the tutorial, which will cover weapons. It is recommended you sell any equipment on your ship at this store so you can fit all of the weapons given to you.</text>

<event name="TUTORIAL_PART2">
	<text>Part 2 out of 10... Weapons!
	FTL Multiverse adds a wide veriety of weapons. This part of the tutorial will cover some of the basic new types of weapons so you can recognize them in-game.</text>
	<choice hidden="true">
		<text>Continue...</text>
		<event>
			<text>ENERGY CANNONS
			Energy weapons are distinct with their bright green lights. They do a combination of both ion and hull damage, but never system or crew damage. They also have a decent fire chance!</text>
			<weapon name="ENERGY_1"/>
			<choice hidden="true">
				<text>Continue...</text>
				<event>
					<text>PARTICLE WEAPONS
					These orange weapons can come as lasers or missiles, and do no hull or crew damage. Don't confuse them with anti-bio weapons, as particles do massive system damage instead, and will usually start a fire.</text>
					<weapon name="LASER_PARTICLE"/>
					<choice hidden="true">
						<text>Continue...</text>
						<event>
							<text>FOCUS GUNS
							Focus guns are similar to beams in how they work, piercing 1 shield bubble per damage (with damage reduction) and never missing. They also do higher damage than their same power beam counterpart, but the catch is they can only hit one room! These weapons are not too common on most enemies, but it isn't impossible to encounter them.</text>
							<weapon name="FOCUS_1"/>
							<choice hidden="true">
								<text>Continue...</text>
								<event>
									<text>CONSERVATIVE WEAPONS
									Conservative weapons use no power, unlike normal weapons, but will require the weapon system to be receiving power through either another weapon or a Zoltan. Attempting to fire conservative weapons when the weapon system is unpowered will let them "charge" shots, which when powered again will release all at once. Enemies can never use these weapons.</text>
									<weapon name="LASER_CONSERVATIVE"/>
									<choice hidden="true">
										<text>Continue...</text>
										<event>
											<text>RECYCLER WEAPONS
											Recycler weapons come in variants of typically ammunition using weapons, but are free to fire! The consolation however is recycler weapons tend to charge longer to compensate for not needing a missile. Enemies will never use these either.</text>
											<weapon name="MISSILES_FREE"/>
											<choice hidden="true">
												<text>Continue...</text>
												<event>
													<text>MINELAUNCHERS
													Minelaunchers might be a weapon you recognize from other mods, for better or for worse. In Multiverse, minelaunchers still do system damage, but the MK 2 and 3 versions do less of it (1 less than base damage). Minelaunchers can also be used to lay minefields at certain beacons to delay the Rebels. They can only be obtained from killing trapper class enemies, or occasional rare events. These Trappers are also the only enemies who can wield them.</text>
													<weapon name="MINELAUNCHER_1"/>
													<choice hidden="true">
														<text>Continue...</text>
														<event>
															<text>KERNELS
															Last but not least, the Kernel weapons are the signature weapons of the Orchids. They use ammunition and pierce shields just like missiles, but always cause a breach and are generally stronger. These weapons are exclusively found on Orchid ships, pirate Orchid ships, and in Orchid sectors.</text>
															<weapon name="KERNEL_1"/>
															<choice hidden="true">
																<text>Continue...</text>
																<event>
																	<text>There are many variants of these different categories, as well as those of the other returning vanilla weapon types. Though there are also a few other weapon categories, the ones mentioned here are the ones to be most on the lookout for!
																	
																	This concludes part 2. Continue to the next beacon to proceed with the tutorial, which will cover drones. It is recommended you take a look at the weapons given here, then sell any equipment on your ship at this store so you can fit all of the drones given to you.</text>

<event name="TUTORIAL_PART3">
	<text>Part 3 out of 10... Drones!
	The number of drones in MV is greatly cut back. Chances are you, you won't recognize nearly all of the drones you find in this mod, and for good reason. Numerous drones were merged together to create "toggle" drones, which can be switched between functions before combat. Along with this, there's also Amp drones, whose power costs can be increased instead, and several new types of crew drones to fill different functions.</text>
	<choice hidden="true">
		<text>Continue...</text>
		<event>
			<text>TOGGLE DRONES
			These drones usually have two different modes (with a few very rare exceptions) that switch its functions. You can change this mode before combat but not during, so make sure you analyze your opponent well to determine what mode will be the most opportune! Toggle drones do not change in power or cost regardless of the mode. Enemies with toggle drones will only deploy it as 1 mode and cannot switch them mid-combat just like the player.</text>
			<drone name="GUARDIAN_1_MISSILE"/>
			<choice hidden="true">
				<text>Continue...</text>
				<event>
					<text>AMP DRONES
					Similar to toggle drones, Amp drones can be configured pre-battle. However, rather than alternative modes, Amp drones can change their power input. More power increases their damage, but they'll also move a bit slower to compensate. Choose whatever mode works best for your loadout, or pick them up early on and increase their power as you progress!</text>
					<drone name="ENERGY_1_AMP2"/>
					<choice hidden="true">
						<text>Continue...</text>
						<event>
							<text>CREW DRONES
							Chances are, crew drones are quite familiar to you from vanilla! Multiverse adds several new types with different uses, but there's another crucial change. All crew drones are now controlled by the player, rather than acting autonomously! Some drones, as the one given here, are also conservative. Unlike conservative weapons, conservative drones do NOT need another drones to be powered (and even work if the drone system is damaged or destroyed), but cannot be deactivated manually.</text>
							<drone name="MANNING"/>
							<choice hidden="true">
								<text>Continue...</text>
								<event>
									<text>Unlike with weapons, most drones from vanilla do not appear in Multiverse. With a few special exceptions, every drone falls into one or more of the categories mentioned here. Hopefully you'll find yourself enjoying using the new drones, rather than selling everything that isn't a Defense drone at the nearest store.
									
									This concludes part 3. Continue to the next beacon to proceed with the tutorial, which will cover augments. It is recommended you take a look at the drones given here, then sell any equipment on your ship at this store so you can fit all of the augments given to you.</text>

	</choice>
</event>
<event name="TUTORIAL_PART4">
	<text>Part 4 out of 10... Augments!
	Much like drones, Multiverse signifigantly prunes the augment pool, moving many of the augments from vanilla to the new internal upgrade system, which you'll learn about later in this tutorial. For now, part 4 will cover some of the other new augment types, most notably combat augments.</text>
	<choice hidden="true">
		<text>Continue...</text>
		<event>
			<text>COMBAT AUGMENTS
			You might recognize combat augment mechanics from other mods, but they have been further refined for Multiverse. These augments can be used before battle, and will provide some effect, usually limiting/disabling enemy systems. Most combat augments will take some power away from the player as well temporarily, but will ALWAYS work against every enemy unless specifically stated otherwise.</text>
			<augment name="COMBAT_WEAPON_JAMMER"/>
			<choice hidden="true">
				<text>Continue...</text>
				<event>
					<text>EXTERNAL AUGMENTS
					External augments relate directly to the aformentioned internal upgrade system, which will be covered in greater detail later on. External augments function as you would expect their vanilla counterpart to, but can be installed at empty beacons for free to be converted to internal versions. You probably won't see many of these unless you start with one, but there are a few events out there that give them.</text>
					<augment name="EX_ION_ARMOR"/>
					<choice hidden="true">
						<text>Continue...</text>
						<event>
							<text>HYPERSPEED AUGMENTS
							Chances are, crew drones are quite familiar to you from vanilla! Multiverse adds several new types with different uses, but there's another crucial change. All crew drones are now controlled by the player, rather than acting autonomously! Some drones, as the one given here, are also conservative. Unlike conservative weapons, conservative drones do NOT need another drones to be powered (and even work if the drone system is damaged or destroyed), but cannot be deactivated manually.</text>

	Developed by: Kix
	Currently Disabled.
	
	An equipment expansion pack meant to be used alongside Multiverse. Includes many various weapon and drone concepts considered, for one reason or another, unfitting for the base mod. While attempting to be balanced, due to the nature of the equipment in this pack as well as the fact it is not part of base Multiverse means there may be a higher variation of balance than usual. The new weapons include those that are niche, too conceptually similar to existing weapons, involve "hard-to-balance" gimmicks, or are just conceptually bizarre.

	It is heavily recommended you do not use ships or other mods not made for Multiverse to prevent issues. However, since you are, we have added some markers needed for compatibility. This will prevent some errors, but does not guarantee you won't have issues.

			<text>You, captain, are now a central part of the largest known conflict in not just the galaxy, but the multiverse itself. After the conclusion of the original Federation Civil War in Universe 0, your home reality, the Galactic Federation defeated Admiral Vance and the Rebellion, securing their control over the galaxy.</text>
			<choice>
				<text>Keep reading.</text>
				<event>
					<text>The Federation struggled with various other conflicts, most notably a cold war between the dangerous Coalition Alliance endorsed by the Slug Kleptocracy, Mantis Hive, Rock Theocracy, and Eargen Republic. This conflict finally escalated into the invasion of Aquarian territory, resulting in heavy losses. After the Coalition's attack temporarily destabilized the Federation once again, Vance ran a covert operation from the Rebel Stronghold to attempt to salvage the heavily protected ancient ruins that the Coalition had been seeking as well.</text>
					<choice>
						<text>Keep reading.</text>
						<event>
							<text>Though the full details are unknown, it is believed that among these ruins Vance's team salvaged the first Multiverse Drive, which he would reverse engineer and install on the remaining Rebel fleet. After a Federation raid on the Rebel Stronghold, Vance and his men fled to Universe 1 and allied with the Rebellion of that reality to overthrow the Federation. Universe 1 now acts as the center of the Interdimensional Rebellion's operations, while Universe 0 leads the counterattack.</text>
							<choice>
								<text>Keep reading.</text>
								<event>
									<text>Fruitless as though it might be, both sides are now locked into a seemingly unending conflict, invading realities to secure the strength and survival of their own faction. Make no mistake - though the Rebellion continues to perpetuate their title of a brave uprising, the Rebellion is well beyond a simple insurrection. Though intel is sparse, it would appear Universe 1 has been transformed into a desolate, industrial dystopia fueling the eternal gears of war that seek nothing less than the total annihilation of the Federation and all non-human species.</text>
									<choice>
										<text>Keep reading.</text>
										<event>
											<text>The whereabouts of U0 Vance are currently unknown, though sightings of suspicious movements of the privately trained MFK Ace corps, undyingly loyal to Vance Prime, have been seen all around the Multiverse. The MFK Aces will likely prove to be your greatest threat, along with the powerful redesigned Flagship model dispatched to this reality to destroy the Federation base and secure a Rebel victory.</text>
											<choice>
												<text>Keep reading.</text>
												<event>
													<text>This is where you get involved. As a Renegade hired by the Federation your goal is simple - destroy the Flagship, and it is highly unlikely the Rebellion will be willing to dedicate any further efforts to capturing this reality. It is far more practical for them to divert the remaining Rebel forces to a different reality. If you fail, it is certain the Federation of this reality will fall, and this will become just another piece in the Rebel's arsenal of enslaved realities.</text>
