Though my species's given name would translate to something similar to 'Ancient', it's probably easier to refer to us as the Obelisks. Our race has been around for far longer than most, the only other competitors we had in our glory days were the Crystals, the Dynasty, and the Lanius."</text>

									<text>"We have been divided culturally by centuries between the Commoners and the Royals, who are biologically much stronger than us and as such the natural leaders, a fact which most of us accept without complaint. We were not always these cubical mechanical things you see now, but the Royal's drive for perfection led to our need to perfect everything we had. Our organic bodies were left behind in favor of these, factoring out any weaknesses like disease or aging."</text>
									<choice hidden="true">
										<text>Continue...</text>
										<event>
											<text>"Though our new bodies struggle at repairing or construction due to a lack of limbs, we've already come to rely mostly on drone technology to serve us. Though our society might sound Utopian, it's anything but. Most of our population is sick and twisted, their egos so large they've come to believe that we are actual gods. This desire to play with life has led to some technological achievements you probably couldn't comprehend."</text>
											<choice hidden="true">
												<text>Continue...</text>
												<event>
													<text>"The Engi race with which you are so familiar is merely a byproduct of an Obelisk cognitive AI, one which is truly sentient, known as the Harmony. When our civilization fell, the Harmony was released into the world and eventually became what it is today. Several other achievements of ours I've noticed have found their way into your society, such as the Zoltan's beloved Great Eye, which is merely a malfunctioning Reality Manipulator of ours. I might even had repaired it for them, had my fleet not been decimated."</text>
													<choice hidden="true">
														<text>Continue...</text>

															<text>"However, our biggest and grandest achievement beyond all else is none other than the Multiverse Drive themselves. See, after our exploitative nature of the universe around us started to catch up to us and we suddenly found our reality dry of the resources we had used up, we sought a way to fix it... by invading other realities for their resources instead. We didn't expect much resistance, until we found more of ourselves on the other end."</text>
															<choice hidden="true">
																<text>Continue...</text>
																<event>
																	<text>"Perhaps if we had been different we could have achieved some grand inter-reality civilization, but instead we followed through with our intent and waged war against ourselves. This was devastating, and within only a few decades, our species had been reduced to a shadow of its former glory. The survivors realized the futility of continuing to battle, and so we sealed ourselves away with the use of a waystone, a device which can disconnect a sector from the usual grid that FTL drives operate with."</text>

We disappeared from the galactic scene ages ago, but now we've managed to crawl back. Our leaders, the Obelisk Royals, are planning to invade and retake Universe 0, and inevitably the rest of the Multiverse using massive stockpiles of supplies kept in several planet-sized vaults. I am part of a small but competent resistance group, and we are working on a prototype bomb called the Paragon. Its detonation will be so powerful that it will not only decimate the entire Obelisk Homeworlds, but collapse the Multiverse itself, shutting down MV drives everywhere.

									<text>The stocky build of a muscular and imposing man with two heavy duty blasters holstered at his hip materializes, presumably from a teleporter aboard the Flagship.

If he knows what the Paragon is, then it's presumable he'll know how to construct and detonate it too. Even worse, as you watch the Flagship jump away, an advanced analysis of his MV drive shows he has one particular reality in mind - Universe 0, the first reality and home to the Federation's Multiverse fleet.
