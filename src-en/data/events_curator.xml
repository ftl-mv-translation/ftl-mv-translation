	Description: I have narrowed down the location of a Union bank holding a copy of the last will and testament left by Mr. Wentworth's parents. While I can already guess what may be on it, knowing the full extent of his inheritance might help gauge more about his past. Please obtain this document for me.
	Requirements: Retrieve Mr. Wentworth's parents' Will.
	Recommendations: I have decoded the latest security password for Mr. Wentworth's account. I suggest you remember it: 7G!O3a0p6n

	<text>[URGENT TASK - ARTIFACT NAME: CRUISER CLASS VESSEL]
	Description: I apologize for being unable to give you schematics regarding Mr. Wentworth's former personal cruiser, but I believe there is something to be gained from this next task for both of us. I have found the location of a complete, automated cruiser class vessel containing an AI core storing data on Mr. Wentworth. The deal is simple, retrieve the AI Core, and you may have the cruiser.
	Requirements: Retrieve the AI core.
	Recommendations: Enjoy your spoils, Renegade.
	
	Payment: High Scrap + Resources.
	Bonus Reward: Cruiser schematics</text>

		<text>Accept the job.</text>

			<text>"Oh, but I'm afraid I failed to mention there's a catch. You won't find the AI core in this next sector. You'll need to go somewhere special for it at the next hyperspeed jump. I am transferring the co-ordinates as we speak. Oh, don't give me that look. It's a simple enough task, Renegade. You'll need to find VP Cayden Stimly of Wentworth Innovations and interrogate him on the location of the prototype. Even someone as simple as yourself can handle it."</text>
