"We understand you are a Renegade, correct? Come, please. The master awaits you, and there is much he must share."</text>
			<choice hidden="true">
				<text>Go with the Orchid.</text>

					<text>Hoping your questions will be answered soon, you follow the Orchid to a large tank-like vessel. According to your database, this is a repurposed Duskbringer army truck, originally designed to carry up to 20 soldiers for rapid ground deployment. Now, it seems its weapon arrays have been replaced with basic utilities like a clothes line and a small battery powered terrarium. The Orchid bows and points to the door, suggesting you enter.</text>

							<text>As soon as you enter you're met with a strange smell, a mixture of spices and incense, which makes a couple of your crew gag. The rattle of pots and other trinkets can be heard from the adjacent room, which reveals a Zoltan in a long decorated robe stirring some strange concoction - maybe soup, though with the smell it's hard to tell - with a big metal pot. "Oh- oh! Friends! I do hope you're friends!" 
							
							The Zoltan hobbles towards you, limping from a glitch in his damaged chassis. As he approaches you, he puts his hand on your face, and begins feeling around your features as if uncertain if you're real. "Huh. Renegades. I know it from the look in your eye. Don't deny it! I am a man - I think a man. What is a man? That's a question for later, hmph - of peace! That is what we call it, I think. But still, I can respect it! The world needs killers... erm... maybe that's an indictment on the world. Wish we didn't. But we do! And that's your job. It's cool. Would you like some soup?!"

							<choice hidden="true">
								<text>Stay for soup.</text>
								<event>
									<text>The Zoltan claps his hands together and rambles about soup for a while as he grabs a ladle from the shelf and stirs his big pot. He rings a bell and several more robed individuals enter the room - a mix of species, but mostly Zoltans and Orchids, who each help themselves to a bowl of soup. As the Zoltan is serving them, you also notice a secret compartment that's opened, and a lizard like creature comes out, scoop up a bowl of soup, and vanish without being spotted by anyone else. 
									
									Once you've all received your soup, the Zoltan beckons for you to sit with him and begins to messily gulp down his entire bowl in a few seconds. "Now that you've so handily accepted my soup, I think we are friends indeed! Oh how lovely, I love meeting new friends. I! - I am Anurak. That is my name, whatever a name might be to you. And you are... no wait, don't tell me. Uhm... hmmm." Anurak contemplates your face for several moments, never making direct eye contact. "You look like a... Shells...ken..bry... Shellskenbry! Yes, that is your name! Most definitely. Hello Shellskenbry!" 
									
									Anurak leans over the table, knocking over his soup bowl and reaching out his hand and shaking yours. "Glad to meet you!"</text>
									<choice hidden="true">
										<text>That's not my name.</text>
										<event>
											<text>Anurak ignores you, instead shifting slightly as the Orchid from earlier brings over a rag and helps wipe up the spilled soup. "Well Shellskenbry, you're probably very curious what's going on! I can answer any question! Well, not any question. Some questions. I actually am in dire need of your help, you see! Long ago, I was a Duskbringer. Big mistake, but those were different times! We were all so angry at the Ministry, the Federation, and the sweet promises of a glorious future were so alluring! But bah, there was nothing glorious. Maybe glorious. Define glorious? No, scratch that. It wasn't glorious at all! Would you like more soup?!"
											
											Without waiting for you to answer, Anurak pushes his chair aside and stumbles over back to the soup pot, fetching another bowl and throwing it down before you, sloshing some of it on you, though Anurak doesn't seem to notice. "By the Eye, I love soup! Best liquid you can consume. That's a lie. No it's not. 
											
											Now, I've made many mistakes in my life, and I'm not proud of them. Personally, I'd like to stay here and hide from them. Unfortunately, my friend Devorak wouldn't. Maybe you've heard of him, maybe you haven't. He's an old veteran of the Fed-Mantis War, and a Duskbringer Warhero. It's funny though, he's not much of a Duskbringer. Seems his mistakes, in the eyes of our 'glorious' leaders - they're not so glorious - is his faltering dedication to the movement. Now he's gotten us BOTH into a pickle!

Now I'm hiding here, but naturally, they're STILL after me! The only way to clear this up, me thinks, is to find Devorak and get him to clear my name of any involvement with him.
													
	That's where you come in! Yes, you, Shellskenbry! I have taken the oath of nonviolence, and cannot travel to Devorak without risking my life. If you could be so kind as to take me there, I'm sure I can convince him to reward you ever so kindly! And I'll make you soup! So, what do you say?"</text>

You rush outside to survey what's happening and spot a Duskbringer elite approaching. Anurak panicks, "They're here! The caravan can't protect itself! Please, help us, or we'll all be executed!

	<text>You've tracked down the hideout coordinates Anurak gave you, an old Ministry research outpost that was abandoned during the onset of the Duskbringer revolution. However, there seems to be little activity both outside and within. Bioscans show only one individual inside, though they don't seem to be a Zoltan. Something is wrong here.</text>

			<text>You land on the landing pad nearby and pull open the rusty doors, noticing scattered Duskbringer armor all over the floor. While there's obviously no corpses, the faint residual energy signatures suggest all of these soldiers died here. Chances are, you're about to find the killer.
			
			Deeper into the hideout you eventually find a main lobby, surprisingly cosy for a once science outpost and now ex-terrorist hideout, with a man in grey armor sprawled on a couch with his arm dangling off, waiting for you. "Good, good. You made it. Was wondering how long until you'd get here, after I spied your ship near that Monk's hideout. Idiotic green freaks couldn't contain their temper even when I told them to wait, and look where it got them! Blown to smithereenes." The man gets off the couch, revealing himself to be of an impressive height. He peels off his painted MFK helmet and places it on the table and reaches out his hand. "I, on the other hand, aren't so stupid as to tangle with Renegades. The name's Saggitarius. Well, not really. The name's Jack. But Vael calls me Saggitarius, one of his goofy lil' nicknames." He flashes a smile and extends his hand even further across the table, demanding you shake it.</text>
			<choice hidden="true">
				<text>Shake his hand.</text>
				<event name="DEVORAK_HIDEOUT_ANGEL">
					<text>Right as you go to grab his hand, he slides it back smoothly and throws up to finger guns. "Oh, too slow! Hahah! Get's 'em every time." The mercenary spins around and flops back onto the couch. "So, with the pleasantries out of the way, shall we begin? I think we shall! If you're observant and knowledgeable - no offense if you aren't! - you'll likely have noticed I am an Angel. One of the Syndicate's goons, minion for Vael, bla bla bla. I'm a Mercenary, a good one. I get things done. I know Renegades and Mercenaries have some bad blood but we're both in the business of efficiency. And I think I've found a way for us both to be very efficient together. It's a bit of a reprisal of a less glamorous plan I had before, but I think we can weave you in and make something that REALLY blows all the socks off!"
					
					The man draws a cigarette from his pocket and lights it with a flame he produces from a miniature flamethrower built into his sleeve. "Since you've met the Monk I'm sure you've at least been introduced to the name Devorak. I'm not quite sure how Zoltans do 'physical attraction' but apparently I've heard he's quite strapping. The darling of not only the Duskbringers but the Ministry too! Indeed, Mr. Rei exists in a grey zone between 'patriot' and 'rebel' to the aspiring youth of the Ministry. Everyone's grown tired of the corrupt faculties of Minister Lumei, and day by day more and more turn to radical venues like the Duskbringers."</text>
					<choice hidden="true">
						<text>Where is this going?</text>
						<event>
							<text>Jack puts a finger to his lips and shushes you. "Shhh, patience Renegade! Don't you care about backstory and context? Where's the fun in this line of work if you don't set the scene first!" The Angel clears his throat. "Now, where was it? Oh yes. You see, Devorak has become the poster child of the entire Duskbringer movement! His face alone has convinced countless Zoltans to betray the Ministry. He's seen as a moderate amongst all of these 'terrorists'. Someone reasonable and rational, turned against only the corrupt Ministry officials who caused all of this mess. But that's just what THEY say at least. I don't really care if he's the nicest guy in the Multiverse or a raving psychopath. He's my target, so no matter what kind of person he is, he's about to end up dead."
							
							Jack pauses, letting this sink in before continuing. "But you see, this is no ordinary hit. For the very people that hired me are the Duskbringers themselves! There's a lot of fear that Devorak may have turned again, and that he's planning to renounce his membership. At such a pivotal moment in the Duskbringer movement... well it'd be quite disastrous, yeah? This whole Universe 1 backstab though? Very, very advantageous. Say... a Rebel killed Devorak before he ever had the chance to denounce the Duskbringers, yeah?" Jack snaps his fingers at you and nods. "That would be VERY advantageous indeed. It'd be the Rebels crossing one final line, and the Ministry isn't going to do anything of course. It's just enough to convince some gullible youth they need to do their part in avenging the fallen hero. Now given enough time surely it'd happen naturally, but time isn't on my clients' side."</text>
							<choice hidden="true">
								<text>So let me guess, you're going to frame Devorak's assassination on the Rebels.</text>
								<event>
									<text>"Rightamundo! The Duskbringers I was traveling with were supposed to set the trap. Lure Devorak out, just in time for us to swoop in and... pew pew! We didn't expect any risk going after the Monk, with the whole non-violent schtick. But turns out, you were there. And now the lure is dead. So, frankly, I think you're sort of in my debt in a way. You ruined the plan, and now you owe it to me to fix it, yeah? It's a win win win! You get rid of a war criminal, the Dusks get their silly war and propaganda fuel, and I get Vael to stop riding my ass. How could you refuse?! You'll need that Monk though for this to work. Someone close enough to Devorak that'll actually draw him out. He still with you?"</text>
									<choice hidden="true" req="unique_anurak" blue="false">

											<text>You turn to Anurak, who's also been listening to the whole conversation. He chuckles nervously to a joke no one else heard, and looks at Jack. "Good, so he's still here. Means this plan might still work!" Jack moves closer to Anurak. "Look, I know it might be hard to turn in your friend, yeah? But think about what you'll gain from it! You want out from this Duskbringer business, right? Well the only reason you're in hot water is because the Dusks think you're with Devorak.

You understand the benefits of paying off a debt. In this business, it always helps to have friends in high places, right? Well, I won't waste any more of your time. I'll patch over the coordinates and we'll be on our way." Jack throws you a thumbs up and begins to leave. Before he steps out the door, he looks back over his shoulder and gives one last warning. "Oh but, just so we're clear Renegade. You're there to lure Devorak out so we can kill him. If you try any funny business with me, my boot crushing your throat will be the last sensation you ever feel."</text>

You contribute nothing to society unless you can see a way to squeeze as much money out of it as possible. No interest in paying off debts you so dearly owe. Fine, if I had my choice I'd just kill you, but for as much as Vael hates you in particular, it'd just be unnecessary collateral damage. But stay out of my way."</text>

At last the floodgates break, and he points his gun right at Jack yelling, "Syndicate bassstardsss! Alwaysss ssscheming, alwaysss plotting the next disssassster! I'm on to you! I know your sssecretsss! Your plansss! I don't trusssst you for one moment! You're up to sssomething more, I jussst know it!"
													Jack laughs gently, genuinely humored by this outburst. "Well if it isn't the weasel that gave Virgo the slip! Good going, really. That man was of no worth to the Syndicate anyways. Hence why he got stuck handling you, of course. Why the outrage anyways, Irwin? Still stuck in your little conspiracy land? Guess what. Everyone's conspiring to rule the Multiverse. It's not a secret, it's very well known and well documented."

As Anurak approaches a small metal door guarded by a burly Outcast, you take a glance around you. No sighting of Jack or any Syndicate or Rebel ships around. Maybe that's for the best?
			
			"Hello door man! Man who guards doors. As you are. Because you're standing by the door!" Anurak laughs uncomfortably and the Rockman growls. "I'm a woman."
			"Oh, yes yes. Of course, I didn't intend to offend! By door man I did not intend to imply gender, only that you are a 'man who guards' doors. Man being as in 'Rockman', in its most gender neutral form! I too am of a neutral gender form, though I do not oft-" The Rockman growls again. "Shut the hell up. Unless you've got business here, you ain't welcome." She looks up at you and your crew. "Specially no Renegades."
			
			Anurak nods. "Yes of course, right... well uh. I do believe we do have business here, yes! My friend Shellskenbry and I are here to find a man named Devorak! About yay high, light green, carries a big goofy looking orange sword. Have you seen him?"
			The Rockman crosses her arms. "Never heard of him. And even if I had, I wouldn't let anyone near him unless they had a password."
			
			"A... A password? Uhm... I don't think I know any passwords. Well, I know many passwords. But I don't know if the passwords I know are the same passwords you know. I can make you some soup! Will that get us inside?"
			"No." The Rockman steps to the side, further blocking the door. You notice a few other guards, all Zoltan, hiding in the shadows watching you.</text>

				<text>If he was here, perhaps you could pass a message to him?</text>

					"And why should I do anything for you, Monk? I know your type. I used to pop the heads off of religious zealots back in-" The Rockman is cut off by a raspy voice gleefully shouting Anurak's name. "ANURAK! You've come to me at last!" A slender Zoltan struts out from the door and pulls Anurak into a brotherly embrace. "My old friend! I heard you had died on some lizard planet!" Devorak pulls away for a second to look his old friend in the face. Anurak squirms uncomfortably in his embrace.</text>
					<choice hidden="true">
						<text>You're Devorak?</text>
						<event>
							<text>Devorak turns to you, as if realizing you're there for the first time. He stares at you blankly dead in the eyes, making you feel very uncomfortable. "Am I who? No, no. I am not Devorak. I am nothing but a hollow shell of light and energy. One which has died and been resurrected for an ignoble cause so many times it can no longer feel pain, nor has any connection to the realm of the living."
							The Zoltan reaches behind him and pulls out his glowing orange sword, and holds it out to you. "This is Devorak. This sacred blade channels the soul of the being who once was me. This is my essence, my life force. If the blade is to perish, so will I." He smiles a little too fondly at the blade, then stows it again.

							"So, dear friend, what brings you here?" Anurak gulps. "Well... uhm... uh... I was uh... You know what... nevermind! Hahah... heheh..." Devorak shakes his head. "Oh come on, you can tell me! We've known each other since... what, forever? Did you change your mind? Have you come to help me? I think the Rebellion's betrayal is finally the ammunition we need to dissolve the Duskbringers, this is our chance Anurak! Our chance to stop this whole mess, to-" 
							
							Anurak finally breaks, cutting Devorak off in exasperation. "I want you to cut any involvement I have in your stupid suicidal ploy! You're going to get yourself killed and more importantly you're going to get ME killed! I don't want a part of this, I want OUT."
							Devorak seems confused. "But... but Anurak, this is HOW we get out. We have to fight back, show everyone exactly why the Duskbringers can't be allowed to win. We can't just do nothing!"
							Anurak keeps shaking his head, smacking himself on the cheek and spinning in circles. "No no no no no no! You didn't HEAR ME! I NEED OUT! OUT! OUT!" It looks like he's about to break down psychologically, when an explosion sends all of you tumbling!</text>

You've come to betray me! Do you even realize what this will do?! The entire Federation could collapse because of this! This city is under Ministry jurisdiction! They won't stand for this!"

It is true, the Federation is imperfect, and is composite of imperfect governments run by imperfect people. Yet it stands to represent one universal dream - true, galactic, or even Multiversal, peace. The Duskbringers don't want this peace, and so in their desperation they've found one final effort. Hiring mercenaries, pirate scum who make this galaxy an even more dangerous and villainous place, to stage a Federation assault on a peaceful Ministry trading port! Are these the actions of self professed heroes? People willing to die for their nation and the good of the galaxy?

As long as this Multiverse stands divided as it is, we will never be free of the Rebel plague or any other threat that might come over us. Fascism, nationalism, they're only pathways to decades of strife and death. How could a Federation that once stood so united in striking down the equally villainous Inquisitions now break apart so easily?"
					Devork swings down his sword and aims it at one of the camera drones, which have now moved in closer and begun to circle him. "To my Zoltan brethren, now is your chance to change the future. Should you call yourself a Duskbringer now, it is never to late to lay down your armor and your weapons, and abandon this terror. Should you be questioning your loyalty to the Federation or the Ministry, just think of what cause you would be giving up, just to become a mindless soldier to a group whose idealogies nearly mirror that of the so hated Rebellion! And should you still be a faithful Ministry or Federation ally, it is still your duty to ensure the everlastingness of this peace. For as long as those like the Duskbringers are at large in this galaxy, you and your peace will never truly be safe." Devorak bows, then stows his sword. Around him, many more Zoltans emerge from the shadows of the building behind you and yell various things against the Duskbringers. Even some dock workers and other civilians join in, and a few Duskbringer vessels from the fight above start to jump away.
					
					As the cameras start to drift away to catch the scene elsewhere, Devorak turns to you. "I cannot discern what intentions you truly had, coming here today. However, if you did come to have me killed, you have shown your mind changed. What would I have learned, if I turned you away now after making a journey similar to mine?" Devorak looks behind him. "Unfortunately, I don't... really have anywhere to go now. I didn't think this far ahead. I need some place to keep this worn out corpse that carries me, so uh... do you need any help on your mission perhaps? I have a ship in storage, it means a lot to me but I don't think I can ever fly it again. You may have it now, I guess. Just don't get it blown up."</text>

			<text>In the haze of the battle you hadn't quite realized that several broadcasting drones had gathered around the city observing you, and some reporters are even on scene. Devorak seems to realize this too, and he rushes over to the wreckage and emerges several minutes later with a struggling body. It's Jack, badly injured, who Devorak flops on the ground and pulls the helmet off. He holds it high in the air for the cameras to see.
			"For years the Duskbringers have petitioned that the Federation has grown weak and useless in its prime age, and have argued the Ministry should divorce itself from the alliance and become a new, all encompassing empire! Yet, in all of these years never once have the Duskbringers been able to truly justify their hatred to the Federation! It is true, the Federation is imperfect, and is composite of imperfect governments run by imperfect people. Yet it stands to represent one universal dream - true, galactic, or even Multiversal, peace. The Duskbringers don't want this peace, and so in their desperation they've found one final effort. Hiring mercenaries, pirate scum who make this galaxy an even more dangerous and villainous place, to stage a Federation assault on a peaceful Ministry trading port! Are these the actions of self professed heroes? People willing to die for their nation and the good of the galaxy? Or is it the work of a group of terrorists trying to seize power at the cost of perhaps the one and only hope we have left of achieving unity in this Multiverse?"</text>

Well damn that to hell, we fought a Civil War too! The one mistake the Rebellion made back in the day, was thinking that just because humans are superior we couldn't cooperate with other races. Just look at these Zoltans. They get the idea. Sure, we have some... ideological incompatibilities, but we can both agree different species are better off unified and separate. But the collective egos of Universe 1 have gone too far, and now they think they can just wipe the Duskbringers out entirely! Screw that and screw them, not if I have my say.

Is this what we've come to? This city didn't even have a military installation, it was a trading port! Back in the civil war the fleet was purely occupational, we held the territory but let people go on with business. Now it's become a ravaging death omen, burning down cities and killing any poor vessel caught in its wake." He takes a deep breath and tries to recollect his emotions. "Regardless, thank you for your collaboration. We'll move these people to the nearest medical facility and come back to search later. I'll have my men give you something on your way out."</text>
