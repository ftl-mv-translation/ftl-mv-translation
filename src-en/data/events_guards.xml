	<text>Apparently, sectors like these are where the legendary Dread-Pirate Tuco once lived. Now, you can find all kinds of people here. Even the Crystal Empire has begun sending "liberators" to the Theocracy, who have found an unexpected sanctuary among the Outcasts. Perhaps you could find the same luck here?</text>

	<text>A few years ago this region was bustling with trade activity. Now it is overrun with bandits and marauders. You should tread lightly here.</text>
	<text>This somewhat isolated region was thrown into chaos at the start of the Rebellion. Even in peacetime it was always beset by pirates but now it houses a center of operations for countless pirate fleets.</text>
	<text>If the reports are true, this area has been under the control of pirates for quite some time. Some traders still attempt to trade with the few settlements that remain, but they do so at great risk.</text>
	<text>A few Federation-friendly planets still exist in this sector, but they are constantly under attack by pirate raids. This is a dangerous sector, so be careful.</text>

	<text>The Dynasty is one of the oldest running known civilizations on record, possibly longer than even the Lanius or Crystals. Somewhere in the timeline a massive chunk of their territory was simply... erased, and no one but the Ghosts know why. And they certainly aren't telling.</text>
	<text>The Ghosts are biological mysteries, and so is much of the Dynasty's history. Maybe if they weren't so busy blaming the Federation for the Rebellion, they'd actually calm down and explain. But what are the chances of that?</text>
	<text>According to the database, it looks like the Rebels have dispatched numerous Auto-ships to these sectors as part of some weird war against the Dynasty. Hopefully you can stay out of the crossfires as much as necessary.</text>
	<text>The Dynasty isn't particularly friendly to the Federation. They seem to have bunched them in along with the Rebels as 'bad men'. Maybe you can break this stereotype? Probably not, but one can dream...</text>
