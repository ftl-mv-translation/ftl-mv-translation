	<text>"Years FIGHTING among the Lost Suns has made my hearing not what it USED to be. The rattling strike of BOMBS, the whistling winds of CHAOS! The screams of... of... of the innocent on the DAY OF TRAGEDY... The good Admiral, her sacrifice... GAH! Traveler, why do you BOTHER me?! Go, leave! You should not still be HERE!"</text>
	<text>"Let me give you a WARNING, traveler. If you hurt Thest or Corby, I will SQUISH your tiny HEAD like a grape between my PALMS. I tear off your LIMBS, feed them to the voracious BAT DOGS, and use your head as a BOWLING BALL. I will SPIT on your corpse, LAUGH at your funeral, and PISS on your grave. DO NOT MESS WITH ME, TRAVELER! DO YOU HEAR ME?! DO YOU HEAR ME!?! I'm sure you do. Now leave."</text>
	<text>"Your cluster is VIOLENT. Your cluster is CRUEL. Despite all the SIMILARITIES, I MISS my home, and I DREAD this place. I do not share Corby's OPTIMISM, but I will keep an... open mind. At the very least, you have MANY weapons. That Traveling Merchant... he is a VENDOR of death and destruction, but at least he is won over with a sizeable WALLET. Just like the ELDERS. Just like the FOREFATHERS. DAMN THEM ALL!"</text>
	<text>"Let me tell you a STORY, Traveler. In my cluster, once, there were FIVE Elders. Toarde, STONEWALL (what a foolish nickname), Rutha, Murvara, and Pretore. They were the WORST of autocrats, and they KILLED many. They killed my SISTER. But... I was lucky enough to meet the Good Admiral. With her help, we laid WASTE to the Theocracy. We PAVED over the Elders! Hahah! It was a brillant victory, and for some years, we found PEACE AND PROSPERITY. But nothing good can ever last. Do not become ATTACHED to your life, Traveler. It is fickle. It will fail."</text>
	<text>"The Good Admiral is ALIVE in this reality! It is TREMENDOUS news. Yet, the CREED does not allow me to visit her. It does not allow us to do ANYTHING. What is the point of COMING HERE, of all our grief, if we are BEHOLDEN to such TYRANNY? I despise it. But Thest says we MUST follow the creed. Thest knows BEST. EVEN I do not question this."</text>
	<text>"Faith gets you NOWHERE, Traveler. There is NOTHING to even have faith in. The truth is that the Multiverse HATES you. It HATES me. It wants us to suffer. And to THIS, I see only one response. I will LIGHT ABLAZE anything which attempts to DRAG me into the dirt. Faith, Hah! I have FAITH in myself and in my GUNS. NOTHING else. Certainly not you, and certainly not this CLUSTER."</text>
	<text>"They say the Good Admiral had a BROTHER. I have NEVER met him. I heard he hid, like a COWARD, when DEATH came for us ALL! I did not HIDE! I will HUNT DOWN this disgraceful Obadann, and I will THROTTLE him. If he is dead in my CLUSTER, then he will soon be DEAD in yours! If only the CREED would let me..."</text>
	<text>"The COUNCIL says I blabber too much. I blabber too much about the CREED. I blabber too much about the Good Admiral. I blabber too much about revenge. I blabber too much about... IT. The dreaded P-WORD of which I must not SPEAK! I do not care if I BLABBER! The Council thinks I am not QUALIFIED for this job. But Thest DEFENDS me. Thest is wise. He is all knowing. The Council FEARS him. HAH! You should FEAR Thest too, Traveler. At least as much as you should FEAR me."</text>
	<text>"You should ARM yourself, Traveler. You might think you are PREPARED, but you are not. Your cluster will need ALL THE MIGHT it can get. Why? I wish I could TELL YOU. But I MAY not. Nor would I if I could. Do not WORRY too much. In time, you will UNDERSTAND why we are here."</text>

	<text>"You know what, I'm done fighting you. This is all so pointless." Leah waits for a moment. "Haha, psych! You should have seen the look on your face! HAHA! Now I'm going to kick your ass for REAL this time! Just you wait, beyatch!"</text>
	<text>"I still haven't forgotten our showdown at Prospect 17! Real smooth use of that industrial Mining Beam! You might have amputated my left index finger, but now I'm going to amputate your face! Beyatch!"</text>
	<text>"You know, those idiots in command keep telling me not to use only Beams! Absolute morons, I tell you what! Wait, what was I doing... Oh right. Die beyatch!"</text>
	<text>You wait for the ship's captain to speak, but you only pick up a hoarse cough. "S-sorry, my throat hurts from all the yelling. I have to whisper. I'm still going to get you this time, BEYATCH! Ouch, that hurt..."</text>
	<text>Right in front of you teleports Leah, just as confused as you are. "Huh? Oh, sorry, wrong ship. Just ignore this." Leah beams away back to her own ship, where she hails you again. "Die, beyatch!"</text>
	<text>"Hah, remember that time when I almost killed you back in the Yura Nebula? No!? I do! I swear it happened. I was so close. Now, I'm finally going to go ALL the way this time, beyatch!"</text>
	<text>"Yo, what's up! You won't believe what I've been up to! I wrote a diss track! And it's about YOU! It goes somethin' like this..." You wait, but no rapping comes. "Okay, sooo I forgot the lyrics. So let's just skip that, and get to the killing, beyatch!"</text>
	<text>"BOO! Haha, scared you, didn't I?! That trick always works back at camp. I can tell because those cowards try and pretend they weren't scared, just like you're doing now! Whatever, now it's ass-kicking time, beyatch!"</text>
	<text>"Guess what, I'm climbing the ranks! My commander finally stopped addressing me entirely yesterday. That just shows how much he respects me! You know, you could use a little respect, worm. I'll put the fear of god in 'ya, beyatch!"</text>
	<text>"My brother Kyle's stationed in the Duskbringer Capitol right now, and he won't be quiet about those annoying explodey hologram freaks. And then I tell him about you, and that shuts him up. How does it feel to be such a pain in the ass, people hate you more than DUSKBRINGERS?! Hah, must suck to suck beyatch!"</text>
	<text>You wait for the ship to make any sort of movement, but there's nothing. Suddenly, Leah startles awake. "Uh, you didn't see me sleeping, right? Oh thank god, it would be so embarrasing if you caught me asleep at my post. Wait a minute... I should be fighting you, beyatch!"</text>
	<text>"I'm getting sick and tired of seeing you everywhere I go! It's like you're following me... creep! That's what you are, some freak obsessed with me because I'm so amazing. Well I don't think highly of stalkers, beyatch!"</text>
	<!--NEW - 5.1-->
	<text>"Hey, yo, whattup! I was uh, you know, reading a dictionary the other day, as us smart people do, and I saw 'Renegade' listed in there. Said you were a bunch of freaks! Yeah! You know shit's real when the dictionary insults you! But you know what hurts more than that? ME insulting you! Haha, take that beyatch!"</text>
	<text>Leah appears on screen, but begins to speak in gibberish. It takes a moment of absolute confusion before she stops and explains. "I've been practicing my Lanius! Did you know they have over 70 different ways of saying stupid in their language? And guess what! You're all 70, beyatch! GOTEM! Er... right, time to fight. Beyatch."</text>
	<text>Leah begins to list off her usual nonsense, but you lose focus and start thinking about other things. Who even sent her? Why, of all people, is she the one you have to keep putting up with? The universe has a cruel sense of humor, sometimes. It's probably laughing at you, right now. It probably laughs every time you meet her.</text>
	<text>Up on the screen pops Leah, wearing a strange plaid hat with a pipe in her mouth. "I've been reading up on this guy, Haynes. He's pretty cool. He's like, a detective, works for the Militia. Kinda hot, just saying. And uh, I bought this hat. Thought it looks cool. What do you think? Actually no, scratch that. You have no taste in fashion. Let's fight, beyatch!"</text>
	<text>"Hey, beyatch! Beeyootch. Bish. Biyitch. Bitch. Oh, ew. No. That doesn't sound right at all. Ugh, whatever. You're going DOWN, beyatch!"</text>
	<text>"Yo waddup, it's the BEAM MASTA! Beyatch! Hope ya ready to get BEAMED! - how's that sound? Working on a new intro for my streams. I think it's pretty cool. You don't have to tell me, I know you think it's cool. Anyways, enough talking. Time to give you a little taste of my Beam mastery!"</text>
	<text>"Hey, hey, beyatch! Ever been to Beam town? No? It's a cool place, just on the edge of... your TOMBSTONE! Yeah, that's right! You're going to Beam town, son! That's uh... a euphemism. For me, killing you. Cause, I use Beams. And tombstones mark where people are burried. And uh... yeah, you get it."</text>
	<text>You find Leah has cut her obnoxiously blue hair shorter than usual. For several moments you stare at each other awkwardly, as she shifts around trying to get you to comment on her hair. When you don't bite, she sighs in defeat and arms her guns.</text>
	<text>"I heard a rumor that you kick puppies! That's not cool beyatch! No one kicks puppies!" When you inquire where she heard this rumor, she shifts around uncomfortably. "Uh... places. Definitely didn't make it up myself. Uh... shuttup beyatch. Just let me shoot you!"</text>
	<text>Leah appears on the screen, talking in a strangely posh and deep voice. "Hoho, cheerio. It is I, Leah Applebuzz, richest woman in the galaxy. Haha... yeah... Someday maybe! But not until after I kick your ass, beyatch!"</text>
	<text>"Was talking to my brother again the other day, and he told me the most insane nonsense I've ever heard. He said maybe I should stop bugging you if I keep failing. HAH, as IF! I ain't never gonna leave you alone, beyatch! Hope you like putting up with me for the rest of eternity!"</text>
	<text>"I bet your parents are ashamed of you! I bet no one loves you! And every day, I bet you wake up hoping maybe today is the day someone finally cares! Haha! Loser!" Suddenly, Leah breaks down crying. Despite the absurd spontaneity of her sobbing fit, she manages to get to her feet and order her crew to attack you.</text>
	<text>"Oh yeah beyatch, it's time for a REMATCH! I know you'll slip up this time! Last time I almost had you, this time I'll get you for sure!" You doubt Leah's claims but there's no point in arguing. Time to fight!</text>
	<text>"I'm not a disappointment, you're a disappointment! Shuttup! I hate you! GAH!" You aren't sure where this sudden tantrum is coming from, but with no clue how to respond, you decide to take the opportunity to attack first.</text>

	<text>"Ack! Not again! Trust me, this isn't the last you've heard of me, beyatch!" Leah warps away.</text>

	<text>Leah puts up her middle finger in a display of contempt and warps away. You aren't sure where she warps away to, but apparently they don't mind taking her back.</text>

<!--this part is messy as all hell so here's a general explanation of how it works:
ALL sectors load the SYLVAN event
SYLVAN event checks challenge level and loads one of the SYLVAN_SPAWNER_ events, which spawns the ship for that challenge level than loads SYLVAN_LOADER
SYLVAN_LOADER checks the current sector and loads the right encounter event

can only hope and pray to whomever this nonsense works

<!--MV REBELS-->
<textList name="TEXT_ENCOUNTER_MV_REBEL">
	<text>It appears you aren't alone! A fellow multiverse traveler, this time a Rebel, has already found their way to this beacon, and is moving in on your location.</text>
	<text>You were aware the Rebels had been finding their way into this sector, but you didn't expect to see a Multiverse-drive equipped vessel defending this beacon!</text>
	<text>It appears you aren't the only ship at this beacon, nor the only ship with a Multiverse-Drive here either! A hostile Multiverse Rebel ship has spotted you and is moving in to attack.</text>
	<text>"Haha! At last we have found you. It only took 768 different realities full of chocolate pudding or shape-shifting god aliens to find you here!" A beat up Multiverse Rebel ship moves in, weapons armed and ready.</text>
	<text>A confident Rebel captain of the nearby Multiverse ship boasts about his abilities at tracking you down, and swiftly gives his crew orders to attack. You figure you should do the same.</text>
	<text>The Rebel ship at this beacon looks like it has been through a lot... and for good reason! It's a ship from across the Multiverse, and it seems they've tracked you down to this beacon and are looking for a fight.</text>
	<text>The Rebels are a common sight all around the galaxy, but the ship here is no ordinary Rebel. They appear to be a Multiverse-Drive equipped vessel, and they've decided to engage you in combat!</text>
	<!--new batch! 3.11-->
	<text>"You're that Universe 0 bloke! Haha, we've got you now. You're one hard fellow to track down, but in the end, the Rebellion will always win!"</text>
	<text>A Rebel Multiverse ship approaches. "You son of a buzzard, do you know how many realities we had to suffer through until we found you? This is like, the 9th version of myself to pilot the 16th version of this ship! So quit running and just die!"</text>
	<text>You're amazed at the amounts of effort these Rebels go to tracking you down. A Rebel ship in poor condition bears down on you, determined not to let you past.</text>
	<!--new batch! 4.0-->
	<text>A mute Rebel officer fumbles, performing lazy sign language your translator slowly converts to verbal communication. "A Free Mantis ripped out my tongue. I blame you. Now I'm going to kill you."</text>
	<text>You receive a hail from an overweight Rebel. "I was an MFK Ace you know, but then I took a Bio-Beam to the knee. But if I can kill you... maybe Vance will give me another chance!" You suspect he's lying, but you don't have time to refute his claim.</text>
	<!--new batch! 4.10.3-->
	<text>The pastel blue hull of a Rebel MV vessel glides past. As soon as they spot you, they power up their weapons and engage!</text>
	<text>A Rebel ship comes screaming into the system... literally. The captain is shouting at the top of his lungs. Some of these Rebels are complete nuts; it looks like you'll have to crack another one.</text>
	<text>"Straight out of Universe 1, and the first thing I find is a Federation Renegade? My luck is never this good! Promotion, here I come..." Seems you'll have to prove this isn't quite the lucky encounter he's looking forward to.</text>
	<text>A Rebel captain appears on the vidscreen, chewing on a squirming bowl of young Orchids. "While tracking you down, we ran out of food. Now I'm stuck eating these gross baby things. Please, just let me kill you, so I can go find some food that doesn't cry when I bite it."</text>
	<text>A nearby Multiverse travelling Rebel ship broadcasts an automated message; "Glory to the Rebellion!" You remember the time when the Rebels cared enough to actually say it themselves. At least, you get to blow them up all the same.</text>
	<!--new batch! 5.1-->
	<text>Most of the Rebel forces sent from Universe 1 are ships like these. Strangely, you don't encounter many of them outside of random chance like this; you suppose the Rebellion keeps its Warp-Bays somewhere else. Regardless, a challenger is beckoning, and you aren't going to disappoint!</text>
	<text>You've heard Admiral Vance has some kind of personal grudge against Renegades, and so the Rebellion relies on its signature blue-clad MV Rebels to carry the burden of the invasion. You wonder how it feels to jump out of U1 just to face down a ship like yours. You're sure glad you don't.</text>
	<text>"I used to be a Fed during the Civil War in U1. But after the U0 invasion began... well... you either became a Rebel or you accepted your death or enslavement. If things had turned out differently... well... I hope you understand none of this is personal."</text>

	<text>"It's okay... I saw this... coming..." The Rebel captain collapses as their ship breaks apart around them. If they saw this coming, they should have thought twice about messing with you. Good riddance.</text>

	<text>"Do you know who I am? If you kill me, my 37 wives will be absolutely devastated! Please spare me, for their sake! But also mostly mine!"</text>
	<text>"I have traveled thousands of realities and no ship has ever fared so well against me as you. You have earned the right to not be killed by me. Please stop." The enemy captain sounds triumphant, but you can see the fear in his eyes.</text>
	<text>"God, this is worse than the time we had to fight off an infestation of parasitic bat-worms! I can't believe I'm saying this, but we surrender!"</text>
	<text>"We will not surrender! Okay that's a lie, we surrender. I really don't want to die."</text>
	<text>"Ugh, I can't believe I've been brought to my knees by such an ugly bastard like you. Will you take our surrender, so my legend doesn't have to end in such a disappointing manner?"</text>
	<text>"I'm too pretty to die! Wait, maybe I can buy this stupid idiot off with some junk... wait, is my mic on?" The ship goes silent, followed by an offer of surrender.</text>

	<text>"Don't even bother trying to run, Federation! Your ship is forfeit to me now! Hahahah!"</text>
	<text>From out of the tunnel comes a foreboding, yet strangely colored Renegade ship. It looks like talking it out isn't an option, because their guns are already firing!</text>
	<text>It's a common philosophy among Renegades that all scrap they can get their hands on belongs to them. You're guilty of this quite often as well, but now another Renegade has arrived and sees you as their next target!</text>
	<text>"Hello there, friend! I have a gift for you, would you like to see it?" You reluctantly ask what it is, only to be met by them charging forward in an offensive attack!</text>
	<text>"Haha, I am but 4 parallel universes ahead of you! But I will not have won until I've defeated you in EVERY universe! Yahoo!" The ship moves in to attack.</text>
	<!--new batch! 5.1-->
	<text>"You have to help me. No matter where I go, people keep calling me a Renegade. HOW DO THEY KNOW?! My name is Dan, I work in real estate, I just bought this ship to give it a test spin, and now everyone wants to kill me. And... and I want to kill everyone! Something's terribly wro-AGH! GIVE ME YOUR MONEY OR DIE!"</text>
	<text>"One Renegade to another, my luck's kinda gone to shit. I heard a rumor, a myth really... but when a Renegade dies, supposedly you wake up in another body and start all over again. Frankly, I'm kind of hoping you kill me. Who knows, maybe some day I'll wake up as you! Hahah! Heh..."</text>
	<text>"You'll never believe what I just came back from! I swear to god, there was this like, big place at the center of everything. There was a talking can of beans, and god himself, except he was a Slug with a big ring... and there was a guy in a maid outfit, and a guy with a card that smelled weird, and... and they were ALL SLUGS. I'M GOING INSANE!" The deranged Renegade raises his weapons, turning to violence in his madness.</text>
	<text>It's strange, seeing so many Renegades around nowadays. A long time ago, there only used to be a few; it certainly wasn't a popular title. But something about the adventure has drawn more people in. As the newcomer approaches you however, it seems one of your adventures is about to end.</text>
	<text>"Father, is that you?! Have you come back to me? You old coot, I hate you! Get out of my LIFE!" You have no idea what the Renegade on the other end is talking about, but whether they're your child or not, they're about to see the business end of your guns.</text>
