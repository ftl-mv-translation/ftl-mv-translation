	<text>"How quaint. I just sold off all my stock and here I was thinking I'd have to make my trek back to Argeonn when you showed up! Thank you kindly for the generous donation, stranger!" You aren't sure what the smugglers are referring to until weapons pop out of their hull!</text>

	<text>The Federation is fairly lax on Argeonn and its smugglers, as their inter-dimensional services make cheap for transportation. With little to fear, a smuggler nearby peddles you some gear.</text>
