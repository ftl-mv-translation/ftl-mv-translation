	<text>You're hailed by a Rebel ship: "When the rebellion is complete you'll see the safer world we provide. Well, you won't, but you get the point." They arm weapons.</text>
	<text>You receive a hail from a Rebel fighter: "I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the-" you cut off the Rebel ship and prepare to fight.</text>
