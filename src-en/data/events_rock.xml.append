									<text>The Dread Pirate Tuco, true to what the Outcast claims, is not so much a singular person but rather a title. The original Tuco for which the moniker was derived lived during the days of the archaic Rock-Crystal Empire and fought against Toarde and the other 4 Rock Elders during the collapse of the Empire. While Tuco's side inevitably lost and the Theocracy rose from the ashes of that war, stories of the ventures of Tuco continued to be shared by Rock school-children even after the Elders forbade them from being told. Several Rockmen have picked up the title of Tuco since then, giving the name even more infamy and immortality. The current holder of the title is believed to once have been known as Rowbad, and currently works as a bodyguard for Ocym, the Aquarian co-founder of the Argeonn smuggler clan.</text>

"Not too long ago, on the cusp of the revolution, protestors had begun to gather on Vrachos IV, the homeworlds of the Rock species and capital planet of the Theocracy! Though they started peacefully, Stonewall (the residing Elder and leader of the Inquisitions) would not dare have anyone question himself or the other Elders, and so he dispatched his Crusader forces to handle the crowds."</text>

Soon, the conflict grew so large that the Paladins from Numa V had to be called, a rare but significant show of force from the Elders. So numerous were the arrests made that it was clear executions would be inefficient, and so the leaders of the protests were killed and the rest exiled. Tuco, with nowhere left to go, journeyed with the countless thousands of other Outcasts to the Badlands, where they founded the first of the Outcast settlements that we live in today."</text>

"It is no secret that the Tiiikaka slavers are only present in our sectors because they have been employed by the Theocracy to capture our brothers and sisters for use in the Coalition construction yards. Tuco himself was one of the many victims of these raids, and so he was taken to the Tiiikaka camps. But Tuco cared not for chains and cuffs, and so at night he put together a resistance effort to defeat their cruel masters. This is where he adopted his title as Tuco, a codename between resistance coordinators so as not to leak the identities of those involved.</text>

He returned to the Badlands, and together with the forces of Admiral Ariadne of the Lost Sun fleet drove Tiiikaka from the Badlands once again. Tuco stayed with us Outcasts for some time until he grew restless, and once again departed to seek greater adventures in the starry beyond!"</text>

"After rescuing the Badlands from Tiiikaka forces, Tuco grew restless living in the Badlands. A life of quiet complacency within the Theocracy, and months trapped in a filthy cell in a Tiiikaka slave camp had filled him with a deep yearning for adventure. Fear not, for the great Tuco lives on to this day! They say he works a position of protection for Ocym, founder of Argeonn! Tuco has not abandoned us yet brothers and sisters - never fear. Before he left, he made a promise that should the Badlands ever be under threat again, we only need to call him back and he will come."</text>

This is Turban, one of the largest centers for trade, commerce, and culture in the modern galaxy, created quite ironically from the former site of a Chrysolic Church and Inquisition stronghold.</text>

            <text>You fly through the city, taking in truly just how massive it is, compared to all of the much smaller Outcast villages you've seen. As a newcomer and a renegade you are welcomed warmly, and your time in the city is a pleasant one. You meet a humble Aquarian fisherman who convinces you to try a sample of some exotic octopus, an exceptionally elderly Orchid Chieftain whom crafts dreamcatchers from his own twigs, and even share an awkward encounter with a very drunken ex-Rebel who claims to be Admiral Vance's long lost brother, who buys you 3 rounds of drinks before passing out. You also find a number of stores selling military supplies with an incredible variety of items to choose from.</text>

Then it dawns on you what this is, just in time for you to take cover as a missile barrage strikes one of the nearby towers and sends it crashing down. The attack is followed by a flurry of more missile strikes as Theocracy and Coalition Bombers begin to jump in. The city is under attack!</text>

            <text>You came here to save the Federation, but what good is that if you abandon everyone else on your path in doing so? You help pull several civilians out from beneath collapsed debris, but after a missile strike almost costs you your life, you realize if you stay on the surface any longer you'll die. Fortunately, a strangely dressed Rockman in worn priest clothing motions for you to follow him. "Come with me, quickly! We must get to the sewers, we'll be safe from the bombardement there."</text>

"You are noble to stay and help these people. There are few who would. Come, not much further now until we reach the sanctuary." True to his word, only a few turns later and you arrive at a crudely constructed door which you slide out of the way. A repugnant smell assaults your senses but you stifle the urge to gag and take a seat next to a sleeping outcast.</text>

							<text>The people in the room pay you little attention, but your companion draws many nasty looks. "Turns out you are a bad omen, Argo. We were warned of your curse, and now look where we are. We should never have given you asylum", spits a young female Mantis with a blood-soaked bandana over her left eye. This insult is met by murmurs of agreement by the rest of the room, who turn their backs to Argo. In defeat, he stumbles over to where you are.</text>

									<text>Argo sighs and slumps back, pulling a small canteen from his belt and taking a sip. "Not long ago, I was in nothing but the highest graces of the Theocracy. My father sat at the table of victors when the Elders divided the Rock-Crystal Empire and seized power, but he was denied a place as an Elder. He warned me that the Elders would not be kind to our heritage unless we continued to prove our loyalty. I served as a Chrysolic priest for many years before I married my wife, Iri. Together we had two children, a son and a daughter."</text>

											<text>"We both knew that neither of their lives would be easy, but we tried as hard as possible to place them in positions of security. Our son was sent to the Inquisition to be trained as a Crusader, while our daughter was promised a hand in marriage with Toarde, the head Elder. She was but a young child at the time, but what were we to do? The Rock people hated us, they saw us as exactly what we were. My daughter hated me too, and one day she simply vanished from her room in Toarde's palace along with her brother. Toarde was furious, and he blamed me because he had no one else to blame."</text>
											<choice hidden="true">
												<text>Continue...</text>
												<event>
													<text>"I was exiled from the Theocracy and abandoned by my wife, who chose to pledge herself to Toarde instead. With nowhere to go I traveled to the Badlands, where I found Turban. The outcasts who lived here hated me, but I was able to survive by proving my usefulness as a guide through the unexplored halls of the buildings. I had helped in the planning for the original construction of Turban before it was abandoned, you see. After the outcasts had established full control I was allowed to stay, but they began to call me the 'cursed one'. A homeless prophet who wandered the streets claimed that I would bring destruction to this place. And... well, here we are I suppose."</text>

	<text>There is a palpable feeling of unease in the room, but every attempt to break the tension goes nowhere. Through the silence you can hear the distant thuds and feel the violent shaking as the bombardment of the city above continues without relent. At this rate, nothing will be left. Hours pass, and you're certain the fleet is making progress on your location. Several times footsteps can be heard outside the room, but no one ever enters.</text>

			<text>Argo begins to hum a tune, some old Rock folk-song, but he's interrupted by an announcement over an old radio in the corner of the room. "Attention all those who remain: return to the surface at once and surrender yourselves. Those who have taken refuge in the sewers or ravines will be quickly snuffed out." You remotely check your ship's radar and see a concerningly large new blip appear. Seems the Theocracy has deployed a cruiser vessel of some kind.</text>

					<text>It seems, despite the silence, that the room has unanimously decided to stand together. As the Theocracy search parties draw near, the door to the room is violently torn from its unstable hinges and you soon find your face on the floor with a gun to your head. Barely any sort of fight is put up as the Theocracy outnumbers your group by almost another 10 soldiers. You're drawn out to the surface, where you find the city is now little more than rubble.</text>

							<text>The Theocracy team transporting the group splits you and your crew off from the others, handing you over to the Coalition troops by the side. During the transfer however, Argo breaks free from his restraints and takes down one of the Crusaders. In the panic, your crew escape and make it back to your ship while the survivors draw arms and battle against the Theocracy ground troops. You trust them to hold their own this time, but they won't stand a chance unless you can take down that cruiser! Not like you have a choice, because it's already locked onto your vessel and is approaching fast.</text>

			<text>It seems the Theocracy's mission is complete, even if some survived. Most of the ships have jumped away, and visibly the survivors managed to scrape through the fire-fight. Among them is Argo, carrying a bloodied staff typically carried by priests such as he used to be. "I am in no way qualified to speak in such manners, but I think it goes without saying we people of Turban thank you. We Outcasts never expected the Federation to aid us in such a way. Assuming it has survived the bombardment, you should find a Rock cruiser on the landing pads outside of the city. It belongs to me, but I want you to have it. I must stay here and help repair the city. Turban will stand once again, I am certain of it."</text>
