	<text planet="PLANET_MOONS">In front of you lays a massive monolith structure on the surface of a moon. The exterior is entirely black, with a few dim lights here and there. Maybe it holds something of value?</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_LAVA">A half cubical ship, split straight down the middle, has crash landed on the nearby lava planet. Though the conditions are hazardous, there might be something of worth remaining.</text>
	<text>Before you lies ruins unlike anything you've ever seen. Entirely black and cubical, the skeletons of a few massive warships remain at this beacon. Maybe you can salvage something here?</text>
	<text>A humongous cubical mega-structure lies in your wake, transmitting a short but undecipherable message. Surely if this thing still has enough power to send a message, maybe it has something worth taking?</text>
	<text>You appear to be witnessing the aftermath of a terribly damaged and brutally torn apart mega-class carrier ship, larger than your cruiser or even the Federation's largest fleet ships. Even stranger, the wreck is entirely black and cubical. Maybe it contains something worth salvaging?</text>
	<text>The remains of a couple strange looking Auto-ships, certainly not of Rebel design though similar in tech according to scans, are scattered around the remains of a massive cubical cruiser. Maybe there's more tech aboard the ship?</text>
	<text>The wreck of a dated and foreign vessel is being pelted by a small and thinly dispersed asteroid field. Though the asteroids have clearly caused some damage, the storm has mostly passed by, and won't be an issue for much longer. Maybe something of value is left behind?</text>

	<text>"We do not know where they came from. Queen Y told us that we were divine. That we were the masters of reality. Yet, the newcomers... they claim they come from beyond, through a tunnel. They call it the [word unknown]. The engineers made no mention of such a place. They speak such strange words. Dreams of gods? A living universe? I see a great threat in them, but the Royals say they will not hurt us. Some kind of pact, a gift of the outskirts in return for peace. I do not foresee good in this, but it is not my decision to be made."</text>
	<text>"I encountered one of the metalloids the other day. In broken dialect it asked me if I could spare it ammunition. To arm himself against my crew, I thought? Nay, he merely scrambled it down his throat, gave a garbled thanks, and drifted away. I sometimes question the origins of them. I would study them, see what makes them tick, but I can never get close enough to capture one before they slip away. It is infuriating. I have never known such failure."</text>
	<text>"The crystalline, the attendant whom I was given by the Royal appointment, tells me strange stories of life in his world. What a simple creature. Why do the Royals painstake us to endure with these mortal beings? They birth, they age, they die. We do not. Even the Commonwealth does not toil in such fashion as them. Perhaps they are glad to have been spared? The Phantoms knew no such luck. I hope to dispose of him soon. Perhaps the appointment will grant me a servant who speaks less next time."</text>
	<text>"Nine months I have served aboard this vessel for Ambassador L. It is insufferable. Life in the slums of the Commonwealth, as grueling as it were, was more pleasant than this. I am treated like... like a crystalline! A mortal! The Royals have forgetten that we too are [word unknown]. I will not stand for this. Tomorrow, I will overthrow the Ambassador. I will leave this place! The Commonwealth will rise, it will prosper! I just know it!"</text>
	<text>"They say the war is going well. I am not so certain. There are rumors, very concerning rumors, of a genocidal plot by the Royals. They talk so often of the Commonwealth, the gears of war. I am afraid they may be the next target. Yes, it will be the enemy. But... the enemy is us. If they are truly parallel to ourselves, should we not expect equal retaliation? I fear the worst."</text>
	<text>"I heard a strange story the other day. They say that the crystalline emperor, Ycathine, had a feud with Queen Y. Stranger yet, he left the palace. Alive. Unheard of... no mortal has ever challenged the Royals and lived! What are we coming to? Have we lost our dignity, to allow ourselves to be spit upon by repugnant beings? In my outrage I slaughtered the last of my servants. It is a small demonstration, but it is a fitting one."</text>
	<text>"War with the Dynasty was a mistake. Not that I fear we will lose. Nay. It is just that... they are so numerous. We were aware of this fact, but not of the severity of it. Our victory is certain, but when will it be? We are running out of time. The Royals continue to lie, they say the war is going spectacularly. But if we keep distracting ourselves with petty squabbles, soon even their tone may shift. They say the Reaper never yields. I did not believe it when I heard it. But, there is too much evidence now for it not to be true."</text>
	<text>"While exploring the other day I came across a remarkable system. A beautiful world populated by strange creatures. With almost no landmasses, the oceans stretched so far I feel as though they could engulf all of [word unknown]. The primitive species here will not bother us. They may even provide great entertainment. I think I shall build a resort here. The Royals are always looking for new ways to spend their leisure."</text>
	<text>"The Monolith looks well. It is a marvelous work of art, and to think inside sits [word unknown]! There are few habitable systems around it, but those that are, I wonder if some day they will birth life capable of appreciating the Monolith's beauty. Should the war go south, should there be left no other trace of us, at least the Monolith shall stand proud as an eternal grace of our perfection!"</text>
