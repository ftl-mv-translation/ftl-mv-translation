	<text>The Lanius don't pick and choose when it comes to their targets. If you've got scrap, they'll gladly take it from you. Unfortunately, you've been detected by a nearby Lanius ship that swoops in to attack.</text>
	<text>Lanius aren't exactly known for friendliness, but an unusually aggressive military vessel has locked onto your ship and is readying its weapons.</text>
	<text>You stumble across a Lanius vessel melting down the last few remains of a heavily armed Zoltan peace-keeping fighter. Wanting to defend their latest score, they don't give you any opportunities and attack immediately.</text>

    <text>Ghosts love getting their hands on new ships, and usually they go for easier pickings. Despite this, the Vagabond ship here seems ready to migrate and they've chosen your ship as their target.</text>
    <text>It's beyond you why most Ghosts choose to populate barely functional wreckage, but it seems the hostile ship here has slightly higher standards and have chosen to take yours next.</text>
    <text>You receive a hail from a dysfunctional and heavily damaged ship, but the only audible noise is static. You attempt to respond but somehow seem to have angered the populates of the ship, a clan of Ghosts.</text>
    <text>The range of ships you see here keeps growing, and it seems 'wreck full of mad gas beings' can be added to the list.</text>
    <text>Ghosts aren't known for being super confrontational, but when they find a ship that piques their interest, they aren't shy to try and take it. Clearly, you've made quite the impression out here.</text>
    <text>You nearly make the mistake of attempting to salvage the wreckage at this beacon before realizing it's populated by Ghosts, but it's already too late. They've noticed you now and move in to attack.</text>

	<text>A nearby pirate ship notices you. It abandons the wreck it's currently salvaging, hoping you'll be carrying a greater bounty.</text>
	<text>This sector has proven to be a magnet for pirates, an unfortunate fact that has led to the confrontation awaiting you at this beacon.</text>
	<text>Few pirates can resist the temptation of a large bounty regardless of the risk, and it seems the pirate barreling towards you has given in.</text>
	<text>It seems a pirate has found their way to this beacon already, and is eager for a fight.</text>

	<text>"Haha! You were expecting another empty colony, but it was me all along!" The nearby Rebel ship locks onto your hull and attacks.</text>
