    <text>This region of space is very different from its surroundings. Someone has gone through the trouble of turning the shells of the ruins into a nice, long tunnel wide enough for your ship to fly through, rather than leaving the shattered vessels strewn randomly across the system.</text>
    <choice>
		<text>Enter the tunnel.</text>
		<event>
			<text>As you pilot your ship into the tunnel, you become aware that someone has been drawing on the walls with a strange sticky, particulate substance. The art depicts Lanius alongside ships, strange cubes, and diamonds, and the quality seems to improve as you delve deeper into the tunnel. Eventually, some rudimentary drawings of solar systems enter your view - though the details you can discern seem to refer to systems that haven't existed for eons. Towards the end of the tunnel, you see a picture where a looming black-and-gold figure is shooing away a small group of Augmented, while a crowd of Lanius watches. A larger, purple-and-white figure is cut off by the edge of the mural, leading the outcasts elsewhere.</text>
			<choice>

					<text>You come upon the most recent string of paintings deep within the tunnel, where an Augmented is finishing up a portrait of the purple and white figure you saw before.
