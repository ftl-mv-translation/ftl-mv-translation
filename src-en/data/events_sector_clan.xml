Strangely, it seems that the first attempt at each one is free, with subsequent attempts requiring a fee.</text>

	<text>It seems you've stumbled across a lush planet teeming with all kinds of exotic life. Judging from the impossibly well kept grasslands and the breathtaking rock sculptures, it seems this must be one of the EHG's best maintained hunting grounds. These locations are reserved for only the wealthiest of customers, not just Clansmen, and are stocked with lifeforms bred offworld. The planet seems to be entirely untouched by infrastructure, though scans show a single abnormality. A ship is on the surface.</text>
	<img back="BACK_EVENT_PONYWORLD" planet="NONE"/>
	<choice hidden="true">
		<text>Approach.</text>
		<event>
			<text>You fly your ship near the crashed ship, noticing that it's a Guild vessel. It's incredibly old however and shows signs of rusting. Several brightly colored equinoids graze nearby, and you watch them peacefully roam when a voice speaks to you. "Do not disturb the equinoids, friend. They are tortured souls, the Guild is not kind."</text>
			<choice hidden="true">
				<text>Who's there?</text>
				<event>
					<text>You spin around but see no one. You lay your eyes on a hazy grey cloud that seems to engulf the area in front of you but are uncertain what it is. "Do not be afraid. We are nothing but an ancient voice. We are the Story Teller, and we have been an overseer of these lands for many years. Would you like to hear a story?"</text>
					<choice hidden="true">
						<text>Sure.</text>
						<event>
							<text>You take a seat next to the grazing ponies, and one wanders over and plants its muzzle on your shoulder. The clouds move around you in seemingly patternless motions as he begins his story. "Once, many years ago, there was a boy who would come here with his uncle. His father was gone, and his mother dead. His uncle was a proud man, but the boy was meek. These trips were unusual and not an easy liberty, but his uncle wanted so desperately to earn the boy's affection."</text>
							<choice hidden="true">
								<text>Continue...</text>
								<event>
									<text>"At first they came and simply watched the wildlife, but they never got too close. His uncle forbade it. One day, his uncle brought a gun. He showed the boy how to use it, and shot a bird from the sky. But all the boy did was cry. His uncle did not understand, and every day this would repeat itself. The pair would come, an animal would die, the boy would cry. The boy wielded the gun several times, and he fired it with deadly accuracy, but never once would he hit an animal. Instead, he would shoot cans and stones."</text>
									<choice hidden="true">
										<text>Continue...</text>
										<event>
											<text>"One day, his uncle simply gave up. He stayed in his ship and let the boy free. He hoped he would learn to grow cold once he saw the equinoids did not share the same love for him as he did for them. But the boy would eagerly spend every day feeding the equinoids in bliss. The equinoids treated them as one of their own foals. The boy and the equinoids had more in common than the boy's own uncle. Bastardized and left without a home, forced into a new purpose by a master who did not understand their true nature."</text>
											<choice hidden="true">
												<text>Continue...</text>
												<event>
													<text>"Every day the boy would beg his uncle to travel here, and every day his uncle's jealousy grew. How could the boy love a mindless alien more than his own flesh and blood? One day, the equinoids roamed further than they had before, and the boy followed. Soon, he even left the sight of his uncle, who in a panic realized he had lost track of the precious child and rushed after him. The boy wandered aimlessly but never afraid until he found a wreck. Mossy and rusted the ship lay in a state of disrepair, piloted by a lost Engi."</text>
													<choice hidden="true">
														<text>Continue...</text>
														<event>
															<text>"The Engi was wounded, having been shot down by a Clansman who had seen through the disguise of his stolen craft. The Engi, too, had befriended the equinoids, and the equinoids thought it was time the boy meet the Engi. Good friends the two became, and for hours they talked of nothing in particular. The Engi had seen many things in his travels but understood little, while the boy had been so sheltered yet understood everything he had seen. The boy taught the Engi many things, and the Engi amused the boy with many stories."</text>
															<choice hidden="true">
																<text>Continue...</text>
																<event>
																	<text>"As night fell, the boy grew tired and bid the Engi goodnight. He walked away, guided once again by the equinoids. The boy never returned. We do not know what happened to him. We miss his voice. The equinoids make good company, but they do not understand our stories..."</text>

																		<text>I assume you are the Engi in the story?</text>

The Clansman doesn't get a chance to finish his sentence when a salvo of lasers takes out his shields then engines, causing him to spiral into a nearby ship and crash into the market below in a fiery ball of destruction! From the sky descends Sylvan's ship, followed by the Salt Man's own cruiser, firing away into the fleet.

"Crap crap crap it'sssss HIM! RUN!" The Clansmen scatter. You knew Sylvan had a particularly... well armed ship, but you didn't think he was strong enough to scare away an entire fleet. Evidently, his departure from the Guild left quite the impression.</text>

Sylvan pauses. "I'm ssssorry Obyn, for leaving. I didn't think I could bear to sssee you again, after ssso much time, but when I heard you might be in trouble, I came. But I... I wassss sstill too much of a coward, ssso I sssent thessse friendssss of mine inssstead."</text>

The two lean in for a hug, though Sylvan keeps enough distance away from their bodies to prevent his flesh from being singed from Obyn's salty exterior. You realise this is quite an ironic relationship.</text>

The Clansman doesn't get a chance to finish his sentence when suddenly his ship collapses in on itself, crumpling up into a small fold of metal oozing green blood. The floating chunk of metal flickers out of existence and you glance over at the gnome, which seems to be jiggling excitedly and breathing heavily. Terrified, the other ships turn tail and jump away immediately.</text>
