On the table are papers with partial translations of the alien hieroglyphics, detailing strange and worrying descriptions of "doomsday bombs", "reality altering monoliths", and a drawing of a cubical robot with a single eye. You heard the Coalition recovered some precursor tech during the Aquarian invasions, but you had no idea their research was this in-depth.
