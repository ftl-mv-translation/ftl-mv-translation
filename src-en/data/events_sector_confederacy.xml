A Zoltan peacekeeper vessel lays in the middle of the streets while crowds of rioting Vampweeds are rocking its hull back and forth and trying to tear off its armor to get inside.

Despite obvious charring, the flames themselves have been extinguished in most of the important areas and the crew is huddled in one of the assembly rooms. One of the factory directors notices your presence. "Oh, Renegades. I... appreciate your hasty effort to save the day, but there was no need. All Confederate factories are by law required to have sufficient fire suppressant systems installed in case of emergencies like this. However, since you're here, we could use some help."
			
			The Vampweed pulls a small canteen full of some lightly intoxicating beverage and takes a few sips. "Fires like this don't usually happen by accident. Our equipment is top notch and our workers are trained well. Seems to me the only probable cause was some kind of Greenleaf communard, trying to destabilize the heart of the capitalist industry! Damn Florals despise our flourishing economy, they say the Gathering council is being pressured to revise their economic system now that the Confederacy has surpassed them.

We were not there, but we did see it passing by. Would have helped, but their kind can be aggressive even when we're only trying to aid them..."

"Sorry, I'm stressed out and I've been drinking a bit too much lately. I appreciate you trying to help us. The Federation can't be so bad if it's got people like you.

When Ivar sees the truth and joins the Coalition, your hypocritical leaders will be annihilated! And until then, we'll have to make do with picking off you intrusive Universe 0 Renegades!"</text>
	<text>Following the Federation-Mantis war, it was agreed during the Kadahellian'ek Treaty that the Gathering and Confederacy would never enter war against each other. Despite this, tensions remain high, and it seems many Vampweeds still hold history against the Federation. One particularly radical vessel nearby locks onto you!</text>
	<text>Vampweeds might not be your friends, but it's not too typical for them to act in such aggressive manners. However, scans show the crew of the nearby ship have succumbed to some kind of parasite that creates irrational behavior. Prepare to fight!</text>

	<text>A drunk Vampweed factory worker's vessel lurches towards you. "Ehhh... dumbass... Feds in my sector? You'll regret this, hear me!" Despite barely being able to form a coherent sentence, the captain is able to order his crew to attack!</text>
	<text>Vampweeds are known to drink a fair bit as a culture, and intoxicated Orchids aren't an uncommon sight here. Unfortunately, the side effects of heavy drinking tend to cause irrational decisions, such as engaging Renegades in combat!</text>
	<text>"I didn't side with the Hive during the old war, but now? Now I think I should have! The Federation has done nothing but push us away when we needed it most, and you're going to regret that!"</text>

Your stake at the Confederacy is long past nullified, so you might as well roll over dead and allow the inevitable to happen!" Seemingly hoping to make rolling over dead more than a metaphor, the Coalition vessel attacks!</text>
	<text>Unfortunately, in light of the Federation's reluctance to welcome the Vampweeds, a large number of Confederate nationalists have taken it personally and are pushing to join the Coalition instead. This has resulted in an influx of Coalition vessels in their territory - not a good thing for you!</text>
	<text>"You claim to represent peace and prosperity, yet where were you when the Confederacy came knocking? When your so called 'mission of unification' really came to the test, the whole galaxy got to see exactly why the Federation must fall. Your claim to this reality, U0 scum, is nullified in the wake of the Coalition! You will be eradicated!"</text>
	<text>The Slug captain of the nearby Coalition vessel hails you, barely holding onto consciousness. "Thessse... Vampweedssss know their way around alcohol, hah! Oh I'm going to... *hiccup* regret thissss in the morning..." A morning he may never see, because as soon as he registers you're a Renegade he decides to open fire!</text>

	<text>The Confederacy has for a while now been playing a part in aiding the revolutionaries against Tyrdeo in the Eargen Republic. All of this, confusingly, has been going on meanwhile as a significant percentage of the Confederacy has been pushing to join the Coalition - of which the Republic is a founding member. This confusing jumble of politics has left many to wonder who is on who's side - such as the lost Leech vessel nearby who's weapons lock onto you out of instinct as soon as you approach!</text>
	<text>"You should have taken the chance to welcome the Confederacy while you could, Federation scum! Now you stand even weaker in the face of the Coalition! We'll pave over you and build a new galaxy free of your tyranny!"</text>
	<text>It seems everyone universally enjoys the sweet mixtures of Vampweed alcohol - or at least particularly violent drunks do. A Republic captain, having just finished raiding a Confederate bar, orders an attack on your vessel admist a drunken stupor.</text>
	<text>A vessel from the Eargen Republic is making back and forth patrols of the area, weapons still charged from some prior encounter, likely with the Confederate military. When they spot you, they lock on and attack!</text>

	<text>The Confederacy has drawn the ire of quite a few humans, who see the raw industrial power of the Vampweeds as a threat to the Union's dominance on galactic manufacturing. Of course, the Rebels have taken this to the extreme and are now making unprovoked attacks on Confederate space!</text>
	<text>"If I had a penny for every time I've run into a Renegade in some random backwater alien sector, I'd have... well, I'd have one penny because this is the first time it's happened. But it keeps happening to my friends too, so it's still kind of a weird coincidence."</text>

You'd best serve up every table a bottle of wine on the house or I'll crash my way back there and do it myself!" The manager trembles and directs the waitresses to acquiesce. A round of drinks is distributed throughout the diner, and the Vampweeds are more than happy to have you join them.  As your crews mingle, one of them even asks to join your crew.</text>

"Are you absolutely sure...? Absolutely nothing?"

"I'm telling you, headquarters went completely radio silent. Met another patrol on the way, they haven't heard anything either."

"Maybe HQ's communications systems are down?"

"Doesn't explain why we can't reach any other ship in that area. And..." The officer's voice quiets down. "I wasn't supposed to mention this - I got orders from the civilian offices routing my patrols away from stars I almost always go through, including Sigma Reticulus."

"Sigma Reticulus... So you were ORDERED to stay away from the Headquarters? But the order didn't come from Headquarters itself? This doesn't sound good..."

"Maybe we should stop discussing this. I don't want to lose my commission for asking too many questions." An awkward silence falls over the officers.</text>

    <text>Alkali is one step ahead of you. As you turn to him, he is using his communicator. "No time to talk. Send the entire garrison as well as a scientist into Ivar's party hall and rescue him." You hear a brief protest, but Alkali interrupts. "Thhhhe researchhh and embassy can go undefended for an hour or so. Thhhhis is a direct order." Moments later, an entire garrison of Shell troops swoop in around the flaming building. They immediately start coordinating the effort to put out the fire and begin rescuing the occupants. Eventually, a Shell soldier comes out of the building, with a small group of Vampweeds behind him. Among the survivors is Ivar, leaning against his spear as a walking stick.</text>

"What, you've never been stabbed in the back by a family-friend? Mr. High and Mighty Scientist Ball over here." The two have a laugh. Ivar turns to you. "Well now, as long as Alkali is on board, I wouldn't mind tagging along as well. What do you say?"</text>

When those simpering flowers joined the Federation, we thought it had no chance to affect the outcome of the war... That worthless shrub convinced the Confederacy to abandon us! We could win a hundred fights on the ground and never make up for the losses the Federation would inflict in a single space battle. Without their weapons, their shipyards, the Hive could never maintain a fleet to continue our conquest." The Bishop pounds the console viciously. He finishes with a cold remark.
