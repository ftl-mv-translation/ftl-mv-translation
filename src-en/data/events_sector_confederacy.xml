A Zoltan peacekeeper vessel lays in the middle of the streets while crowds of rioting Vampweeds are rocking its hull back and forth and trying to tear off its armor to get inside.

Despite obvious charring, the flames themselves have been extinguished in most of the important areas and the crew is huddled in one of the assembly rooms. One of the factory directors notices your presence. "Oh, Renegades. I... appreciate your hasty effort to save the day, but there was no need. All Confederate factories are by law required to have sufficient fire suppressant systems installed in case of emergencies like this. However, since you're here, we could use some help."
			
			The Vampweed pulls a small canteen full of some lightly intoxicating beverage and takes a few sips. "Fires like this don't usually happen by accident. Our equipment is top notch and our workers are trained well. Seems to me the only probable cause was some kind of Greenleaf communard, trying to destabilize the heart of the capitalist industry! Damn Florals despise our flourishing economy, they say the Gathering council is being pressured to revise their economic system now that the Confederacy has surpassed them.

We were not there, but we did see it passing by. Would have helped, but their kind can be aggressive even when we're only trying to aid them..."

"Sorry, I'm stressed out and I've been drinking a bit too much lately. I appreciate you trying to help us. The Federation can't be so bad if it's got people like you.

When Ivar sees the truth and joins the Coalition, your hypocritical leaders will be annihilated! And until then, we'll have to make do with picking off you intrusive Universe 0 Renegades!"</text>
	<text>Following the Federation-Mantis war, it was agreed during the Kadahellian'ek Treaty that the Gathering and Confederacy would never enter war against each other. Despite this, tensions remain high, and it seems many Vampweeds still hold history against the Federation. One particularly radical vessel nearby locks onto you!</text>
	<text>Vampweeds might not be your friends, but it's not too typical for them to act in such aggressive manners. However, scans show the crew of the nearby ship have succumbed to some kind of parasite that creates irrational behavior. Prepare to fight!</text>

Seemingly hoping to make rolling over dead more than a metaphor, the Coalition vessel attacks!</text>
	<text>Unfortunately, in light of the Federation's reluctance to welcome the Vampweeds, a large number of Confederate nationalists have taken it personally and are pushing to join the Coalition instead. This has resulted in an influx of Coalition vessels in their territory - not a good thing for you!</text>

	<text>The Confederacy has for a while now been playing a part in aiding the revolutionaries against Tyrdeo in the Eargen Republic. All of this, confusingly, has been going on meanwhile as a significant percentage of the Confederacy has been pushing to join the Coalition - of which the Republic is a founding member. This confusing jumble of politics has left many to wonder who is on who's side - such as the lost Leech vessel nearby who's weapons lock onto you out of instinct as soon as you approach!</text>
	<text>"You should have taken the chance to welcome the Confederacy while you could, Federation scum! Now you stand even weaker in the face of the Coalition! We'll pave over you and build a new galaxy free of your tyranny!"</text>
	<text>It seems everyone universally enjoys the sweet mixtures of Vampweed alcohol - or at least particularly violent drunks do. A Republic captain, having just finished raiding a Confederate bar, orders an attack on your vessel admist a drunken stupor.</text>

	<text>The Confederacy has drawn the ire of quite a few humans, who see the raw industrial power of the Vampweeds as a threat to the Union's dominance on galactic manufacturing. Of course, the Rebels have taken this to the extreme and are now making unprovoked attacks on Confederate space!</text>
	<text>"If I had a penny for every time I've run into a Renegade in some random backwater alien sector, I'd have... well, I'd have one penny because this is the first time it's happened. But it keeps happening to my friends too, so it's still kind of a weird coincidence."</text>

"Sigma Reticulus... So you were ORDERED to stay away from the Headquarters? But the order didn't come from Headquarters itself? This doesn't sound good..."

Send thhhe entire garrison as well as a scientist into Ivar's party hall and rescue him." You hear a brief protest, but Alkali interrupts. "Thhhhe research and embassy can go undefended for an hour or so. Thhhhis is a direct order." Moments later, an entire garrison of Shell troops swoop in around the flaming building. They immediately start coordinating the effort to put out the fire and begin rescuing the occupants. Eventually, a Shell soldier comes out of the building, with a small group of Vampweeds behind him. Among the survivors is Ivar, leaning against his spear as a walking stick.</text>

"What, you've never been stabbed in the back by a family-friend? Mr. High and Mighty Scientist Ball over here." The two have a laugh. Ivar turns to you. "Well now, as long as Alkali is on board, I wouldn't mind tagging along as well. What do you say?"</text>

    <text>As you hail the Coalition Predator, you're greeted by the sight of a Mantis Bishop. "You have stuck your ugly nose where it doesn't belong, Renegade! The Hive has unfinished business with this meddlesome bureaucrat. This will be your one chance to escape death at our hands."</text>

        <text>Ask them why they hate Ty E'Rel.</text>
        <event>
            <text>"Pah, Renegades and their insipid curiosity." The Bishop hesitates, but then unloads into a furious rant. "The Hive was winning! When those simpering flowers joined the Federation, we thought it had no chance to affect the outcome of the war... That worthless shrub convinced the Confederacy to abandon us! We could win a hundred fights on the ground and never make up for the losses the Federation would inflict in a single space battle. Without their weapons, their shipyards, the Hive could never maintain a fleet to continue our conquest." The Bishop pounds the console viciously. He finishes with a cold remark. "His infestation must be burned from the galaxy, to send a message to all who would refuse an alliance with the Hive."</text>

                    <text>The Bishop aims a sharp appendage at you. "Had it not been for my queen, I would have killed him long ago. But she was convinced they would turn against us even more if we attacked their diplomats."
						
The Bishop spreads its appendages wide. "But the Coalition has shown her a new path... and now there is nothing holding us back!" The Coalition ship turns to face yours - it looks like a conflict is now inevitable! "You ask too many questions. You cannot be allowed to live!"</text>
