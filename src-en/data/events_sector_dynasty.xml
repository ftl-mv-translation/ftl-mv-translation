	<text>While it can be hard to tell the differences between nebulas, something is definitely off here. Several bright lights through the clouds guide you to a massive Dynasty mining colony, built in loosely-joined structures around a fleet of ancient and dilapidated ships. You expect to see heavy traffic, or at least signs of activity, but the colony is mostly dormant. Even stranger, a fleet of Duskbringer ships have surrounded the colony as well. What could be happening here?</text>

Do you know how many times I've been called a 'breather' here? What kind of insult even is that? Sure, we have to wear these big ugly suits just so we can breathe, but at least our biology isn't comprised of hot air!"
					
					The Duskbringer smirks and leans back in her chair. "But I'm getting carried away. I assume you're peaceful, since you aren't shooting yet. So, if you're up for it... I have an offer. We took this colony a few weeks back in hopes of securing part of the Dynasty's Aether supply. It's gone wonderfully, except these damn Phantoms started teaming up. Now, the Dynasty's sending Vagabond hitmen to screw with us, hoping we'll leave before long. I sure as hell ain't losing to a species as inferior as this. Hmph. The Dynasty had its prime some eons ago, but now it's time for a new glorious empire. One run by Zoltans, but to make that happen first we need the kind of weapons this Aether will go towards making.

	<text>After a long day working on the always damaged Auto-ships they construct, it's no wonder the Engineers feel the need to let off some steam. Alas, it looks like you're their next target!</text>
	<text>"Oh come on! I haven't even finished my lunch break! You picked the wrong time to ruin my day, asshole!" Hostiles inbound!</text>
	<text>Could it be? A Rebel ship? Your eyes aren't lying to you - and this is no ordinary Rebel. It's an Engineer, but they're no less deadly!</text>

	<text>"You are not father. Father is not as ugly as you. Entering combat mode." The nearby Rebel Auto-ship suddenly activates and attacks!</text>
	<text>You assume this to be an empty beacon... until you notice the dozens of dormant Auto-ships floating through the nebulas. You try to avoid them, but unfortunately it looks like one of them has noticed you and attacks!</text>
	<text>You practically bump hulls with a Rebel Auto-ship, but it's too late to slip away before it's already noticed you and started to attack!</text>

    <text>For what reason is this beacon marked as important? As soon as you jump in, it's clear. A Dynasty outpost has been established here, and the beacon marker was a warning for ships to stay away. Somehow they haven't spotted you, yet...</text>
    <text>Looks like a broadcast in many different languages is being sent out from a nearby Dynasty outpost. It's right to the point: "This observation location is not to be tampered with. Attempts to raid or damage Dynasty property will be met with lethal force."</text>
