Several bright lights through the clouds guide you to a massive Dynasty mining colony, built in loosely-joined structures around a fleet of ancient and dilapidated ships. You expect to see heavy traffic, or at least signs of activity, but the colony is mostly dormant. Even stranger, a fleet of Duskbringer ships have surrounded the colony as well. What could be happening here?</text>

Do you know how many times I've been called a 'breather' here? What kind of insult even is that? Sure, we have to wear these big ugly suits just so we can breathe, but at least our biology isn't comprised of hot air!"
					
					The Duskbringer smirks and leans back in her chair. "But I'm getting carried away. I assume you're peaceful, since you aren't shooting yet. So, if you're up for it... I have an offer. We took this colony a few weeks back in hopes of securing part of the Dynasty's Aether supply. It's gone wonderfully, except these damn Phantoms started teaming up. Now, the Dynasty's sending Vagabond hitmen to screw with us, hoping we'll leave before long. I sure as hell ain't losing to a species as inferior as this. Hmph. The Dynasty had its prime some eons ago, but now it's time for a new glorious empire. One run by Zoltans, but to make that happen first we need the kind of weapons this Aether will go towards making.

	<text>It's strange how aggressive the Dynasty is, especially when the breakaway Vagabond Ghosts are much more reclusive. Though, perhaps that may be why they broke away in the first place. You'll have to think about this later, as a Dynasty vessel is inbound!</text>	
	<text>Make no mistake, the ship coming at you isn't friendly. A Dynasty vessel lurches forward, eyeing your weapons before attacking!</text>	
	<text>A garbled message comes across your radio. "Weapons. They belong to me. GIVE!" A Dynasty ship uncloaks nearby, weapons drawn!</text>	
	<text>For such an elegant name as the Spectral Dynasty, their ships are uncharacteristically hostile and violent. There's no better example than the vessel here, as it approaches menacingly.</text>	
	<text>A shot flies right past your ship, and seconds later a purple vessel comes drifting out of the clouds. Looks like it's Ghosts... and they don't look friendly!</text>	
	<text>A bloodchilling scream fills your speakers, followed by unsettling static. Any captain with lesser nerves might have fainted on the spot, but you know better. This isn't some demon, this is a much more real threat. A Dynasty vessel approaches!</text>
	<text>Looks like you're receiving a short range broadcast. "Your flesh shall appease the demon's heart one more day. Your weapons shall be its destruction! For the good of the Dynasty!" A Ghost vessel appears nearby, weapons drawn and already firing!</text>
	<text>An unsettling chant echoes through the nebula as a ship approaches. "The demon's heart shall cease! The demon's heart shall cease!", followed by the flashing of gunfire as a Dynasty vessel draws near. Are you the demon? You aren't sure, but you won't have time to ask!</text>
	<text>In light of the seemingly empty nebula, you make conversation with the crew on enemies you could have found here instead. As soon as one of them mentions the Dynasty, a ship comes barreling out of the nebula, as if it were summoned. Speak of the devil...</text>
	<text>At first you assume the static over the radio to be nonsense, but suddenly your translator starts to pick up words! "A breather! In Dynasty space, how putrid. It turns my insides into coils of anger. I will unleash hell on you scum!"</text>

	<text>You notice a Vagabond ship nearby watching you hungrily. "In my heart I feel the desire of a new vessel... this one is depreciated and has failed its function..." The Ghosts attack!</text>
	<text>A Vagabond, likely fleeing from Dynasty patrols, has stumbled right into you. "You side with the Dynasty, nay? Oh, for what am I asking. The risk is not worth it, I shall simply remove you from my path."</text>

	<text>After a long day working on the always damaged Auto-ships they construct, it's no wonder the Engineers feel the need to let off some steam. Alas, it looks like you're their next target!</text>

	<text>"You are not father. Father is not as ugly as you. Entering combat mode." The nearby Rebel Auto-ship suddenly activates and attacks!</text>
	<text>You assume this to be an empty beacon... until you notice the dozens of dormant Auto-ships floating through the nebulas. You try to avoid them, but unfortunately it looks like one of them has noticed you and attacks!</text>
	<text>You practically bump hulls with a Rebel Auto-ship, but it's too late to slip away before it's already noticed you and started to attack!</text>
	<text>Curse the Rebels and their massive fleet of Auto-ships at constant disposal. Looks like you have another ship to take care of before you can carry on.</text>

    <text>For what reason is this beacon marked as important? As soon as you jump in, it's clear. A Dynasty outpost has been established here, and the beacon marker was a warning for ships to stay away. Somehow they haven't spotted you, yet...</text>
    <text>Looks like a broadcast in many different languages is being sent out from a nearby Dynasty outpost. It's right to the point: "This observation location is not to be tampered with. Attempts to raid or damage Dynasty property will be met with lethal force."</text>
