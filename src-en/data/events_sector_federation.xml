	<text>Your arrival at this beacon is met with an unusual sight; an unarmed Illesctrian ship far from Zoltan territory.

"Renegade, this multiversal conflict is one of an endless cycle, one that you seem to be at the core of. But are you really fighting to try and end it, or just to perpetuate it further for your own gains?"

"Hello, Renegade. There is a problem: The other ships are claiming that our crystal arsenal didn't sway the tide of our battle in our favor!" 

The Orchid speaks up. "I'm sorry you had to get pulled into this Renegade. I do want to point out that our kernels penetrated the enemy shields and knocked out their engines. It's thanks to us that you had the accuracy you did."

The Zoltan snorts. "Baffling argument. Ludicrous, even. You may have scratched their paint job, but our Lucerne beam did the lion's share of the work. We did the most hull damage, therefore we were the most consequential ship in that fight. We don't even HAVE to aim."

Orchid nods, pleased, "Of course! We are stronger together than we are apart. It makes sense!" 

The Engi cocks its head to the side. "Compatibility = high. Renegade experience = greatest among us."

    <text>At this beacon, you find three Federation ships: a corvette, a fighter and a light cruiser. You can tell that there is a lot of comm chatter between them, suggesting that something serious is happening. As you arrive, the light cruiser's captain invites you into the open communication channel.</text>
    <choice>
        <text>Respond to the hail.</text>
        <event>
            <text>"Renegade, I'm glad you are here," says the light cruiser captain, "We've got a major situation on our hands. A Federation Captain went turncoat - or was a spy - and replaced his crew with Rebels! The trouble is, I'm not sure which it is, and we have no way of escorting both of them."

The captain of the fighter chips in. "Are we seriously leaving this up to a Renegade? How do we know they're not just interested in our scrap?"

"You would say that, Rebel!" The captain of the corvette says. "They're still Federation where it counts."

The fighter captain crosses her arms. "We're Federation through and through. I'm confident that we can prove it. Can you say the same?"

The captain of the light cruiser holds up his hand. "Settle down, and stop posturing. Renegade, do you have any ideas?"</text>

                    <text>Tully glances at the security feeds. As the three captains realize the admiral is in their midst, their reactions are revealing. The corvette's captain seems to look surprised, before putting on a poker face, while the other two look on in admiration. The light cruiser's captain holds his hands open. "Admiral! I didn't realize you were here!"

"Thank you both for your service. I need to talk to this defector." Tully's eyes meet the captain of the corvette. "So, why did you do it?"

"I..." The captain begins to crack. "While I was... in the academy, the Rebels took my planet. And, they gave me a choice."

"I understand. Still, you made an oath. We have three ships, and you have one. Do right by your men and surrender. They will be taken as POWs and treated fairly."

The captain nods, and surrenders.</text>

                    <text>"Oho, a mystery. I believe I'm in my element here." Haynes gestures with his pipe as he studies the feed of each ship. "Hmm, intriguing. I can't help but notice that on the fighter, there is a Federation-issue gun lying in the corner of the cockpit. Quite curious, considering you might expect a discarded weapon if there was a scuffle."

The captain of the fighter looks panicked. "I can explain!"

Haynes shakes his head. "In addition, your pilot is wearing his uniform incorrectly. Can you explain that?"

"I-I must have told him to correct it a thousand times! But I swear, he's as loyal to the Federation as he can be."

"You're right- because you're NOT the impostor."</text>
					<choice>
						<text>Continue...</text>
						<event>
							<text>The fighter captain's face turns from panic to confusion, then relief. "W-what do you mean?"

"Your ship bears dirt, dust, clutter and residence. The other ship is suspiciously clean, spotless and with no character. I suspect we could uncover more."

The corvette captain has a poker face. "We have nothing to hide. We clean our ship properly."

"Then, since you have nothing to hide, I'd be glad to see a video of the last time you cleaned. Surely it was within the last 24 hours? And, I'm sure there's no blood residuals either, hm?"

After a staredown, with three other ships aiming their weapons at them, the corvette finally stands down.</text>

"Guys! Get in here, it's Jerry!" The other Rebels start to filter into the room.

The captain looks alarmed. "What are you doing?"

"Dude, we can't lie to Jerry, man, come on."

Jerry smiles. "Would you guys mind giving the Federation their ship back?"

The captain seems unhappy at the situation, but his crew don't seem to want to harm Jerry.</text>

"The nature of our movement is that we stand to make room for the superior lifeforms in this galaxy - to give them their rightful place. It is a fact that more often than not, the Zoltans are who possess these superior characteristics, but that is not to say ALL Zoltans do. Those we have found in this unholy temple of false peace have betrayed their species to work hand in hand with lesser beings, thus becoming lesser themselves."

The galaxy should have already accepted the Zoltans as the superior race - we have the better tech, the better culture, and the better minds. Sure, there are species who are stronger, or better adapted to certain environments - but there is a place for them in our new galaxy. It just won't be at the top.

We are millions strong and growing, and our methods harm no one but those directly opposed to us. You are nothing but Renegade filth, who are you to say such things? You don't know politics, you don't know-" The Zoltan is cut off by abrupt gun-fire, as the guards open fire while the Duskbringers are distracted.

	<text>Around you, you can see Rebel ships beginning to flee as the Federation forces push them back. Their last hope, the Gunboat and your target, has already taken critical damage. You have to keep fighting!</text>

<event name="FED_MEMORIAL_DESTROY">
	<text>The Gunboat has received critical damage, too much for it to sustain. Its artillery system crackles and the engines explode. The ship goes spiraling down into the nearby lake. It explodes one last time once it collides with the water, showering the coast. The sight of their leading ship dispatched so efficiently is enough to chase away the rest of the Rebels. Every last hostile ship jumps away, leaving the Federation the undisputed victor.</text>

	<text>The lifeless Gunboat begins to plummet towards the ground. It smashes into the coast, erupting into a glorious display of flames, though luckily it causes no damage to any of the infrastructure of the city.

	<text>You are hailed by a Federation officer in the city, who requests that you land. As you exit your vessel, all around civilians cheer for you. You recognize Vice Admiral Adara, the voice who spoke to you. "You have done us a great service today. I do not know how to thank you for protecting this city. I have heard stories, well, myths and legends really, of the Multiverse Renegades, and I've always been skeptical. Now, all of my doubts have been assuaged."</text>

			<text>Adara puts a shiny medal around your neck, an honor that you will carry on for life, assuming you succeed in your mission. Every support ship in the district is dispatched to aid you in every way they can, and you're even given a fresh new Federation cruiser from one of their hangars. You don't really have a use for this ship, so you forward its blueprints to the hangar.</text>
