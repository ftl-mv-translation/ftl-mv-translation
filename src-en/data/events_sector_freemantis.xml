					"Needing time to review documents, will let Jelinek go first!"

					Nodding, Jelinek begins. "After the Mantis schism following the conflict between the Humans and Hive, the faction known as the Free Mantis coveted territory. The Free Mantis began to settle on worlds within Ministry borders without permission, worlds not far from the planet we hover over today. The Ministry, after a short grace period, sent a cease and desist order, along with a small contingent of ships. The bureaucracy of the Ministry demands that proper procedure be followed at all times within the Ministry. If that is done, we can be very reasonable. However, the ships sent to inform the Free Mantis of their unwarranted occupation of Ministry territory were met with escalation as the ships demanded to continue staying, and violence broke out once the Free Mantis categorically refused to move. It is the opinion of the Ministry that if the Free Mantis wished to settle any worlds, that a full petition should be sent through the bureaucracy of the Federation, where all the members can peaceably discuss which worlds the Free Mantis may settle. The Myrdal has been sent to determine if concessions can possibly be made that can satisfy both parties and end both the fighting and the occupation." Jelinek pauses. "Is my opposing counsel ready?"
					"Yes. Have documents, am ready." Ziiilizekii replies.</text>
					<choice hidden="true">
						<text>Hear out the other side.</text>

							<text>Ziiilizekii begins reading from a written document, struggling. "All of us in the Free Mantis were vulnerable shortly after leaving the Hive. We had nowhere to go. The culture we'd grown up with was brutal and violent, it didn't value talking or procedure. We didn't even know that the worlds we first settled belonged to the Zoltans. We picked systems that were close to the Humans, but not within their space. Just when we had started to get our bearings, a fleet of angry vessels came down to demand that we leave. Our leaders told them that we had no knowledge of how to know where we could settle, how to go through Federation or Zoltan bureaucracy. We found worlds to support us and we had our people live there. Our leaders decided we weren't leaving without another world to go to, and the Zoltans said that wasn't their problem, that we had to go. A fight broke out, and the Free Mantis needed to expand. We tried to have the smartest among us petition the Federation for help, but they kept telling us to wait. We understood this to mean that we should wait here, on these worlds... and we have waited. But in the meantime we have to fight the Zoltans who say we cannot wait, we must leave." Ziiilizekii looks up from the paper towards you.</text>

The Hive wants us dead. We are being shamed, but not shown a good path."

	<text>Amongst the many wrecks of what was once a Free Mantis clan are three Rebel ships, their guns blazing. One of them spots you and attacks!</text>	
	<text>You receive a hail not long after jumping. "At last! I thought our detour into this forsaken sector would be the death of us, but now that you're here, things are starting to look up!"</text>	
	<text>Blaster fire batters your defences, and a Rebel ship moves in to attack!</text>	
	<text>The captain of the Rebel ship approaching you hails, "Do you know what trouble you've caused, creating these murderous psychopaths? Worse than the Hive Mantis, I can tell you that. Consider your deaths my revenge for the crew I've lost to your fanatics."</text>	
	<text>The Free Mantis have actively been searching out and killing Rebels in their territory, but the one here appears to have escaped from their grasp. They're quite eager to engage you!</text>
