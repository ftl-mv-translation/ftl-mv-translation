Surely you didn't think that I - a flower defined by her desire to protect the helpless - would just let you get away with bringing harm to helpless sprouts, even if they weren't sapient."</text>
    <text>"I am not going to back down here, so you'd better listen good, Captain. These children deserve to have a long and healthy healthy life, as any child does in this multiverse. Sapient children often have a long period of time in which they are vulnerable in order to properly form their mental faculties, and Orchids are no exception. That you would prey upon something which is so helpless speaks to your callous disregard for life."</text>
    <text>"Who do you think you are, that you can waltz in and order the deaths of children? Not only have they done nothing to hurt you, they wouldn't even be capable of trying.

It's not simply a matter of prioritization of the needs of the youth over the needs of the elder, those wounds of childhood are so much more potent. Is that something you want on your conscience?"</text>
    <text>"SHUSH! I'm still talking. Is it that you don't respect us, or that you don't respect people who are younger than you in general? Is this perhaps a species thing, or are you incapable of empathy for those who are less developed than you? I'm genuinely curious - if these looked like little human sprouts, would that stay your heartless amusement?"</text>
    <text>"Zip it, chowderhead! You purport to be a savior of the Federation. Well, start acting like one! No monster who commands the deaths of children could ever be worthy of saving anyone. Commit whatever garden variety war atrocities you want, but I insist that you leave the children out of it!"</text>

Or... have your forsaken your humanity in this vocation, that you plan to die in the stars, never giving a damn about any who do not serve to benefit you?"</text>
    <text>"You still have the opportunity to do the right thing here. The vile act has not been committed yet. These children can still live a long and fruitful life free of the cruel machinations of a multiversal vagabond. Turn off your weapons and we can all move along and... well, I won't forget this, but I'll let it slide."</text>

	<text>Gathering sectors are known hotspots for wealthy Zoltan and Rock traders. Of course, such abundant wealth serves as a honeypot for the flocks of pirates looking to scavenge a pretty penny.</text>
	<text>"Honestly captain, I'm no pirate. I'm a warrior for the free market!" A pirate captain smiles smugly at you. "Just... a very, very free market. These flower communards though? They don't know a single thing about how money works! I'm doing you all a favor by cleaning them out. Unfortunately, you're in my way. Gotta get you out of it."</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_POPULATED">You gaze out the window at an overgrown Orchid planet when a pirate jumps in out of nowhere. It appears conflict is inevitable.</text>
	<text>"I'm sick of these plants! They're boring! I go to a tavern looking for a good time and instead I just find a bunch of monks throwing me hand signals! God, it's driving me mad! Mad enough to kill someone!" The pirate blinks when he notices you nearby. "Hey... speaking of someone to kill!"</text>

	<text>The Theocracy will make allies with any nation willing to accept the Chrysolic faith within their borders. The Gathering has been very receptive to this faith, and unfortunately a heavy flow of Theocracy ships that aren't quite so friendly to you keep finding their way here!</text>
	<text>"You know nothing of faith, Renegade! Look around you and witness the holy alliance of sillicon and leaves! When the Federation crumbles, the Gathering will not mourn your death, instead they will join us in holy matrimony! Tremble before my crusading might as I vanquish your evil from this place!"</text>
	<text>The first contact between the Florals and the Theocracy happened many centuries ago, but it was the beginning of the Gathering's interstellar colonization projects. Ever since, relations between them and the Theocracy have been very solid. As solid, perhaps, as the hull of the irate Rock vessel barreling towards you.</text>
	<text>A babbling Rock captain, drunk on Floral-made beer and perhaps some narcotics too, starts shouting insults at you and raises his weapons to attack!</text>

	<text>A Rebel vessel approaches cautiously, trying to figure out your purpose here. "This sector belongs to the Rebellion, and always has! The Federation will respect our claim to the lands of all inferior species or we will annihilate you like we should have during the Civil War!"</text>
	<text>"You know the thing I like about the Orchids, captain?" A Rebel captain takes a whiff of his cigar and frowns at you. "They don't scream when I kill them. Makes it easy to give the orders to shoot, 'cause I know my men don't have it in them to mow down pleading civilian families when they can hear them. You on the other hand... no matter how much you plead, nothing's going to stop us from painting the walls red with your blood."</text>
	<text>"Glory to the Rebellion! Your choice in defending these communist flowers betrays your claims of representing a prosperous galaxy! There is nothing prosperous to be found here!" The Rebel ship's weapons lock onto your hull and conflict becomes unavoidable.</text>
	<text>A Rebel vessel, likely sent here to take advantage of the usually non-violent Florals, has identified you as a Federation-hired Renegade and is firing! You have no choice but to defend yourself.</text>

    <distressBeacon/>
    <text>By the time you reach the beacon, a Praetor seems to have already responded to the distress call. Its origin was a small, brown shuttle - they seem to be discussing something.</text>
	<preventQuest/>
    <choice>
        <text>Respond to the distress call.</text>
        <event>
            <text>"...and maybe this Federation ship can help me. Renegade! It's good timing that you have come. The Praetorian are committing a grievous wrong, one that only the Caretakers of Rt'lak Et are trying to fix!"

The Praetor grumbles. "I am not saying I support what's being done. But the Praetors are preoccupied. With the recent campaign against our border, we cannot afford the infighting. We don't have the resources."</text>
            <choice>
                <text>What's going on?</text>
                <event>
                    <text>The Caretaker leans in. "The Gathering is forcibly relocating many natives of Rt'lak Et, which will no doubt inflict considerable harm. You need to help us make our case to the Gathering, stand up for those who cannot stand for themselves. None of the other Florals are willing to help."</text>

                            <text>The Caretaker lets out a sigh. "The Kadahellian Schism began after the Theocracy uplifted us. This allowed us - the Ctl'Yae - to explore until we found Rt'lak Et, our greatest gardenworld. Nowhere else in the known galaxy does such a lush and perfect environment exist for advanced plant life. While we have many garden worlds, Rt'lak Et is special. Our people grow and manufacture our best ships and weapons there. But our government has decided to lower themselves to relocating many species which cannot survive in weaker climates offworld in the name of stepping up weapon production. The long term ecological ramifications could be severe."</text>

                                    <text>The Praetor shakes her head. "The Duskbringers believe they can weaken the Federation by burning down our Gardenworlds. For the most part, they had been unsuccessful, as we diverted the majority of our forces to hold the line. Truth be told, for as long as our production gardens are under threat, the Gathering is likely to push for heavier militarization. Unfortunately, one of their number managed to make it into our territory anyway. We can't divert any more ships away from the front lines, which means our ability to chase them is limited. The best we can do is defend our core worlds and hope they don't do much damage."</text>

                                            <text>The Praetor clenches her foliage. "Our listening post at Kat'ar Lek went dark. We had a Praetor stationed there, and they haven't been responding. We don't have the resources to send another right now, and they can destroy most other Floral vessels. If you can take them out, they lose their one foothold in our territory, which we believe will force them to back off. And if this happens, I can certainly convince my government to offer you a ship for your fleet."

The Caretaker adds. "If you want to help us, the first relocation transport is on its way to its destination. I can transmit coordinates so that we can intercept them. Either we can talk some sense into them... or, we might have to get a little aggressive."</text>

Bralmeb seems uncomfortable. "Well... I..."

"So you're lucky that the attractive powerhouses over here love making peace as much as I do! Listen, this doesn't HAVE to be an interstellar incident. Just calm down, take your lumps and listen to this lovely Caretaker without judgement, okay?"

Bralmeb is still miffed, but for the moment he seems pacified.</text>

"You said that you were stepping up military production because you feel that you are not properly represented on the galactic stage. Is that true?" Bralmeb nods. Tully continues. "Your people are often hesitant to ask for planets in other systems or military aid. Why then, are you resorting to such drastic measures in your own space?"
