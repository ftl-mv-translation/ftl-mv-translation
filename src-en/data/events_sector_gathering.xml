Surely you didn't think that I - a flower defined by her desire to protect the helpless - would just let you get away with bringing harm to helpless sprouts, even if they weren't sapient."</text>
    <text>"I am not going to back down here, so you'd better listen good, Captain. These children deserve to have a long and healthy healthy life, as any child does in this multiverse. Sapient children often have a long period of time in which they are vulnerable in order to properly form their mental faculties, and Orchids are no exception. That you would prey upon something which is so helpless speaks to your callous disregard for life."</text>
    <text>"Who do you think you are, that you can waltz in and order the deaths of children? Not only have they done nothing to hurt you, they wouldn't even be capable of trying.

Is that something you want on your conscience?"</text>
    <text>"SHUSH! I'm still talking. Is it that you don't respect us, or that you don't respect people who are younger than you in general? Is this perhaps a species thing, or are you incapable of empathy for those who are less developed than you? I'm genuinely curious - if these looked like little human sprouts, would that stay your heartless amusement?"</text>
    <text>"Zip it, chowderhead! You purport to be a savior of the Federation. Well, start acting like one! No monster who commands the deaths of children could ever be worthy of saving anyone.

These children can still live a long and fruitful life free of the cruel machinations of a multiversal vagabond. Turn off your weapons and we can all move along and... well, I won't forget this, but I'll let it slide."</text>

	<text>A Rebel vessel approaches cautiously, trying to figure out your purpose here. "This sector belongs to the Rebellion, and always has! The Federation will respect our claim to the lands of all inferior species or we will annihilate you like we should have during the Civil War!"</text>
	<text>"You know the thing I like about the Orchids, captain?" A Rebel captain takes a whiff of his cigar and frowns at you. "They don't scream when I kill them. Makes it easy to give the orders to shoot, 'cause I know my men don't have it in them to mow down pleading civilian families when they can hear them. You on the other hand... no matter how much you plead, nothing's going to stop us from painting the walls red with your blood."</text>
	<text>"Glory to the Rebellion! Your choice in defending these communist flowers betrays your claims of representing a prosperous galaxy! There is nothing prosperous to be found here!" The Rebel ship's weapons lock onto your hull and conflict becomes unavoidable.</text>
	<text>A Rebel vessel, likely sent here to take advantage of the usually non-violent Florals, has identified you as a Federation-hired Renegade and is firing! You have no choice but to defend yourself.</text>

    <distressBeacon/>
    <text>By the time you reach the beacon, a Praetor seems to have already responded to the distress call. Its origin was a small, brown shuttle - they seem to be discussing something.</text>
    <choice>
        <text>Respond to the distress call.</text>
        <event>
            <text>"...and maybe this Federation ship can help me. Renegade! It's good timing that you have come. The Praetorian are committing a grievous wrong, one that only the Caretakers of Rt'lak Et are trying to fix!"

The Praetor grumbles. "I am not saying I support what's being done. But the Praetors are preoccupied. With the recent campaign against our border, we cannot afford the infighting. We don't have the resources."</text>
            <choice>
                <text>What's going on?</text>
                <event>
                    <text>The Caretaker leans in. "The Gathering is forcibly relocating many natives of Rt'lak Et, which will no doubt inflict considerable harm. You need to help us make our case to the Gathering, stand up for those who cannot stand for themselves. None of the other Florals are willing to help."</text>

                        <text>The hell is Rt'lak Et?</text>
                        <event>
                            <text>The Caretaker lets out a sigh. "The Kadahellian Schism began after the Theocracy uplifted us. This allowed us - the Ctl'Yae - to explore until we found Rt'lak Et, our greatest gardenworld. Nowhere else in the known galaxy does such a lush and perfect environment exist for advanced plant life. While we have many garden worlds, Rt'lak Et is special. Our people grow and manufacture our best ships and weapons there. But our government has decided to lower themselves to relocating many species which cannot survive in weaker climates offworld in the name of stepping up weapon production. The long term ecological ramifications could be severe."</text>

                                    <text>The Praetor shakes her head. "The Duskbringers believe they can weaken the Federation by burning down our Gardenworlds. For the most part, they had been unsuccessful, as we diverted the majority of our forces to hold the line. Truth be told, for as long as our production gardens are under threat, the Gathering is likely to push for heavier militarization. Unfortunately, one of their number managed to make it into our territory anyway. We can't divert any more ships away from the front lines, which means our ability to chase them is limited. The best we can do is defend our core worlds and hope they don't do much damage."</text>

                                            <text>The Praetor clenches her foliage. "Our listening post at Kat'ar Lek went dark. We had a Praetor stationed there, and they haven't been responding. We don't have the resources to send another right now, and they can destroy most other Floral vessels. If you can take them out, they lose their one foothold in our territory, which we believe will force them to back off. And if this happens, I can certainly convince my government to offer you a ship for your fleet."

The Caretaker adds. "If you want to help us, the first relocation transport is on its way to its destination. I can transmit coordinates so that we can intercept them. Either we can talk some sense into them... or, we might have to get a little aggressive."</text>

Bralmeb responds immediately. "Tully...? Why are you involving yourself in our affairs?"

"You said that you were stepping up military production because you feel that you are not properly represented on the galactic stage. Is that true?" Bralmeb nods. Tully continues. "Your people are often hesitant to ask for planets in other systems or military aid. Why then, are you resorting to such drastic measures in your own space?"
               
"...it is not our way. We do not like to be seen as dependent. We want to be self sufficient and provide for others."
               
"The Federation is meant to be a collaborative effort. We encourage you to ask for more - after all, your people are often generous."
