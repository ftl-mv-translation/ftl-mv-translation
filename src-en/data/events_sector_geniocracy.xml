	<text>You receive a hail from a Federation vessel hiding in the nebula. "Oh, good, you must be the backup we called for! We were transporting troops to Node 17 when we were forced to detour through this sector. We thought we would be fine until a Shell Abductor came from nowhere and abducted our crew! We suspect they're being held at this beacon in a nearby laboratory, but we don't have enough firepower to rescue them on our own."</text>

			<text>The station is unlike any other station you've ever seen. Massive and painted in the colors of an Elite, this must be an important location.</text>

				<text>Hail them and negotiate peacefully. No need to murder these scientists.</text>

					<text>"Oh, a Federation vessel. Welcome to thhhis beacon! What can I do for you?" You explain the situation, and the Shell seems to contemplate for a moment. "Oh, I see. My apologies, it hhhas always been Shell custom to study creatures who enter our space. We bring no harm to thhhem of course, we simply bring thhhem aboard, run a quick few painless tests, and send thhhem on our way. We meant no harm! Do not worry, I'll have thhhem all released immediately. We want no trouble."</text>
					<choice hidden="true">
						<text>Continue...</text>

							<text>While the Shells are releasing the Federation crew, you notice another jump signature has been detected. Suddenly, a large stealth vessel jumps into the beacon. You catch a message sent from the ship to the Shells. "This is DA-SR 12, responding to the Federation distress beacon. You are in possession of Class-B Federation personnel. We will be docking with you shortly, you will surrender and be taken aboard for arrest or we will use force."</text>

						<text>You take a quick look around the station before you leave and find a strange device in one of the laboratories. It appears to be made to emit the neurotoxin that usually protects Shell ships. The one installed in the lab must have broken during the fight, judging from the fact you're able to be here now, but this one is fully functional. You bring it back to the ship.</text>
