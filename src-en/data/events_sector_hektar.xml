Not to speak so... lowly of the others, but the gap in our intelligence is often paramount. Nevertheless, it is the matriarchy that used to thrive on our homeworlds. But poaching from the EHG, slavers even before the time of Hektar, and ancient wars within our species have reduced our numbers greatly. With so few of us left on the homeworlds, it is vital that I return. Thank you, strange but kind soul. I am forever indebted to you. I will send with you the most able of fighters among us to assist you. They will be loyal to your cause." Vunk motions with her giant leg to one of the younger lizards. "Go now, little one.

	<text>The clouds here are thicker than usual, and a violent storm rages on. You wander aimlessly hoping to find something, and eventually come across a very small Hektar pod drifting nearby, maybe only as large as two rooms. Your scans cannot penetrate its shell no matter what you do.</text>

There's no possible way to break it open without jeopardizing the structural integrity, and the security system is so advanced you doubt you could break through before the Rebel fleet arrived. Whoever built this clearly doesn't want people messing with their stuff.

Sylvan being the traveling merchant - because he's a merchant who uh.. travels. And well, I knew Sylvan back in the day. He took refuge in my monastery while on the run from the EHG (that's the Exotic Hunter's Guild, Shellskenbry. I know, these acronyms are so confusing!) and set me up with a nice little spot on some lizard planet in the Ministry Capital! And while I was with that unusually nice Slug I learned his password! Apparently according to his boyfriend, he always uses the same one for everything! They were always arguing about it. They were arguing about everything, actually. Ah, young love.

It was a sanctuary, away from his parents and his brother! Terribly sad upbringing, it always pained me to hear about it. The poor Slug, he was so nice and yet so troubled... This place was his home away from home, or something like that! I think he wanted to bring his boyfriend here, but I'm no third wheel. Their secrets are my secrets too, so don't ask!

	<text>At first this beacon seems rather unassuming, until you spot the massive spherical shipyard hovering above the ground. Upon further inspection, beneath it appears to be a rural village of some sort, definitely not one of a space-faring species at least. The village below is bustling with what looks to be lizard creatures. You've noticed these guys working aboard Hektar ships before, but with an educated guess you can assume this is where they live. Very strange, but as you approach the shipyard, it becomes apparent there's more here than you first observed. An orange spectacled lizard with a suit and backwards tie is screaming into a megaphone trying to calm down a crowd of irate lizards with picket signs and armed weapons.</text>

"Yes, yes, hello. I am Metyunt, the manager of this facility and caretaker of the Lizard... uh... population. Workforce. Yes, that's the word." Metyunt pushes the glasses back up onto his face, unfazed while a flaming stone is thrown nearby and some lizard rioters tear apart a Hektar ship in the background. You also notice a very large Slug ship hovering above the crowd. It's not firing yet, but you suspect if the crowd pushes things too far, this is their plan to suppress it.</text>

They call me a traitor because I 'sold out my own species to a corporation', but look at it this way. It's paid labor, and they signed the contracts. We were living in squalor, but our queen-chief Thek and her council thought it wise to make some... trade agreements with Hektar after we were approached by two Slugs with a deal. I'm just the mediator, and we're better off with this path anyways. Hektar supplies our species with weapons and armaments, and we supply them with work. If we didn't arrange this, then soon enough we'd either be forced to migrate to some wasteland planet by a Ministry contractor looking to build a new law school, or left for dead when the Rebels come calling." 
					
					Metyunt reaches for a bottle of eye drops and drips them into his eye, then ducks as some alien fruit comes whirling by. "I'm doing my best to keep the working conditions fair and orderly, but they just can't see that! I need them to open their eye, because if it weren't for me, Hektar would be a hell of a lot crueler."

							<text>"Well I'm sorry if you don't agree, but as I may remind you, you're in debt to the Hektar corporation, so I'm not inclined to take advice from you. I suggest you leave, I have enough to handle at the present moment." Metyunt only barely finishes his sentence when an explosion sends you all flying forward as one of the rioters accidentally sets off an explosive charge in one of the ships stored in the hangar. The Hektar officers watching spring into action and Metyunt follows behind them latching onto the one in charge and trying to stop him from giving the order to fire. The Slug grabs the lizard by the tail and flings Metyunt away, then orders the vessel above to open fire on the crowd. The lizards scatter as lasers pelt them from above.

They refuse, but using a charismatic technique in the Renegade business called "pointing your gun at someone", the lizards seem to see the reason in your words and go scurrying back to their huts. Strangely, Metyunt seems more perturbed than relieved by this, but the Hektar officers who were watching are grateful and offer a reward.</text>

							"Hektar has betrayed us, fool! The weapons never came, and the queen-chief has abandoned us! Now, we are being taken as slaves, yet you stand here and say we are better off? You are either naive idiot or malevolent jester! Take your pick!" Guntput swipes his spear at Metyunt, who leaps backwards as several Hektar employees shuffle forward and draw their guns in precaution, but Metyunt tells them to put their guns away.
							"Shaman, I'm tr-"
							"Do not call me that name! You do not owe me respect when you have abandoned our species for greedy capitalist slimemongers!"
							"Okay, then Guntp-"
							"No, do not call me by name either! You are not deserving to utter it!"
							"Please, I'm trying to reason with you! I didn't abandon our species, I did my best to HELP us! Thek made up her mind on the deal, all I did was negotiate a more hospitable offer. It wasn't even going to be paid labor! There's only so much leeway I can get with Hektar, but I did everything I could!"
							"Nonsense and malarkey! You are lying through teeth. If you did not abandon us, then why are you living here, wearing suit and backwards tie, monocle and carrying clipboard!"

It's obvious the lizards don't want Metyunt around. You offer to drop him off somewhere else in the sector, but he declines. "I'm afraid it is best if I find a different occupation.
