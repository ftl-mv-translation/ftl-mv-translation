Even if I were to withdraw from the Coalition, which frankly is an idea I would not entirely be opposed to, you would have to convince the Leikonpliiinakra of every reality to withdraw as well. You might not realize it, but the Coalition has secured many realities of its own. But regardless of this, the Hive is not in a position to cut ties with the Coalition. After the Federation-Mantis War our economy has been in ruin, and the industrial might of the Kleptocracy and Theocracy have aided us greatly."</text>

															<text>With that conclusion made, Leik turns back to Kazaaak. "My apologies dear, but in your absence the Hive has not grown fond of you. Traveling in-arms with another traitor to the Episcopacy and a Federation Captain has not helped your image. I love you, but my role as queen means I must place the safety of the Hive first. It is clear where your line in the sand has been drawn, so this must mark the end of us. And I'm afraid there is another reason I have allowed you here: the capture of the fugitive you have brought with you, Laiiikarkapi. I apologize my dear, for it was my fault appointing you to this role. But such things cannot go unpunished. This is the last stop for all of you. I can at least promise you your funerals will be held with honor." Leikonpliiinakra stands up, and her guards draw their weapons. You hurry out of the palace just in time to witness a massive cruiser approaching to stop you! Seems it's time to fight your way out of here.</text>
