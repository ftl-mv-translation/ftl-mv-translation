Everyone knows they're called bolts, not nuts. A nut is something you eat, they aren't made of metal!" To prove his point, Cole holds up the aforementioned bolt, which is a screw.

After several painfully long minutes of this, Cole offers you a reward for declaring him the victor.</text>

It alarms both of the technicians, who apparently have no experience with the grey blobs. At first, they assume the creature simply means to tell them that the object is in fact called a 'Pook', but your Morph doesn't stop. Growing ever more concerned at the increasingly more aggressive chanting, the technicians beg you to make it stop, and offer you consolation to leave. Your Morph, unfortunately, doesn't stop.

"Greetings! I am famed actor Cornelius Parrysmith, I am sure you have heard of me, yes! Perhaps you are not aware, but here we are filming a most gripping documentary of the good admiral himself! And I, famed actor Cornelius Parrysmith, have been chosen to play the star role!

Yet, Ellie seems completely unfazed by the insult, perhaps not even registering it. "I'm on my quest to kill Wentworth! And everyone else who wronged me! I've already killed Darlen, and Kalie, and Peterson, and Oughfben, and Orson, and... and... well I've lost track now! Heheh..."
Now, Cornelius's shock seems real. "S-Stephan, my god. The divorce really drove you off the rocker, hasn't it. You were always a batshit unstable lunatic before, but this really takes the cake! Why are you still wearing your horse costume? Oh wait, let myself, famed actor Cornelius Parrysmith guess - you're all washed up and it's the one thing left that gives you any joy left in this world? How sad... well it would be sad if you were the least bit sane. But you're not, so why would I, famed actor Cornelius Parrysmith, pity you?! Hah!"
					
Ellie brandishes her knife closer to her chest, her eyes glazing over in bloodlust-driven enthusiasm. "Oh Cornelius, don't think you're off my list just because you gave me some acting tips back in the day. Ellie the Equinoid will always be a better and more beloved role than anything you've ever done. I never liked you in 'Flight between the Stars'. But me, washed up? No no no...

	<text>"You thought you could hide. You cannot hide. I am programmed to be perfect at hide and seek. I have found every ship to ever hide in this system. My programming insists that I should be insulted at the thought that you could hide. I think I will kill you. Yes. The programming never lies."</text>
	<text>Just when you thought standard Auto-ships were enough of a plague, these Innovation Autos are even worse. At least for every one you fight, it's one less the fleet can use against you later.</text>
	<text>It seems there's no end to W.I.'s supply of crimson Autos to throw at you. You suppose this journey would be awfully boring without some fodder to plow through with your cannons though.</text>

	<text>The sight nearby causes you to jump back in shock, as a creepy and demented face smiles at you from the other side of the beacon. Once you recover from the shock, you realize what you're looking at is a large station, which shows up on scans as the location of "Flowers and Sunshine Studios", the creators of the well known Union children's show Ellie the Equinoid.

A large blue spider animatronic welcomes you in the station and advises you keep a close eye on any children so they don't wander into staff only areas. You aren't quite sure what you're even doing here, but if you're going to explore you should make it brief.</text>

However when inspecting it further, you realize with some disappointment it is only configured to fire horse-shaped plushies. The store's clerk mentions the thing has been sitting there since even before the Ellie show was cancelled. Figuring you could get some use out of it, you buy the gun anyways.</text>

	<text>You try your hardest, and just barely manage to squeeze your way into the top 5 high scores, enough to win a prize. You head over to the prize counter, which is ran by a bored looking teenager human. She rolls her eyes at your excitement but hands you a small metal pin with a cartoon spider on it. You can probably pawn it for something worthwhile.</text>

<event name="ELLIE_STUDIO_GAME_JERRY">
	<text>You expect Jerry to finish relatively soon, but instead he just keeps on going, even when the game starts to become obviously and ridiculously hard. Nothing can break his concentration, not even the growing audience of children and arcade enthusiasts watching him and cheering with delight as he progresses into the triple digits of levels. Racking up a score of several hundred thousand, by the time the difficulty exceeds human limitations, Jerry's surpassed the previous top high score by more than three times as much. Even still, he seems uncharacteristically mad at himself. "I could have done better. The version I had in the Protectorate had a bit more health and better items but... Oh." Jerry seems to finally notice the crowd watching him. Embarrassed, he slinks away to the prize counter.
	
	The prize is only a metal pin of Sammy the Spider, which Jerry barely even seems to look at before handing it to you. "I was hoping for something Ellie related. I don't really care for Sammy... maybe you can pawn it? This is quality metal and some collector will probably want it."</text>

You incur several minor firefights, but miraculously the only casualties are on the corporation's side. After an awkward stay in the crowded citadel elevator for some 30 floors, you find your way to the office of Mr. Cayden Stimly - Vice President of Wentworth Innovations, and your target. The shriveled prune of a man - the left half of his face bleached from the fires of a Theocracy Inquisition many decades ago, sits behind his elaborately decorated swivel chair, facing the maw of a giant window with a view of the entire city.

											<text>In the meantime, your crew have moved about the room and are now quietly playing some form of playground game with their appendages to pass the time. Stimly reaches to his right and presses a button on his chair for the intercom, and calls for his secretary to bring him some water. She comes bustling in the room, gives you barely half a glance and walks past, hands him a glass, and waltzes back out without a word of your presence. Stimly barely even mutters a mention of gratitude and continues to stare absently out the window.</text>

In the pursuit of creating the advanced cognitive C.I.C.A. the two groups wished to study our highly advanced A.I. - the closest thing prior to C.I.C.A. to representing truly self-aware A.I.; Wentworth Innovations won the bidding race, but Arcadia won the contract, thanks to a deal between the CEOs. Even though CICA is now employed by Universe 1, Pinnacle continues to contribute to the Wentworth family and is a proud component in the ever evolving field of advanced robotics."

I was fine with this at first. After witnessing the damage they created while malfunctioning during the Vek crisis, I understood it was a necessary step to keep them offline for the forseeable future. Unfortunately, I have now become privy to disturbing information. It seems W.I. has begun trade negotiations with Universe 1 to incorporate my children as part of some new secret military campaign.
