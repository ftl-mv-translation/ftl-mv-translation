"Hahaha! Alright, good boys and girls! Come and join Ellie's righteous crusade! Neeiiigh! For the happiness of all children, we will slaughter any who censors Ellie!" The Rebels practically kneel. Well, at least Ellie found some fans who are as looney as she is.

The Rebels have a momentary look of confusion as they realize who Stephan is. "Stephan? Visiting us? You know... I had always dreamed of meeting you. You could do a lot of good for our cause you know, getting the word out there-"

"Hold on - I'm going to cut you off there. Right now, I have a debt to repay the people on this ship. I think it's great that you're practicing your ideology, but... I don't think my show alone is going to do much good. There's so many more relevant changes you could make in Rebel space - stuff that might actually change things for the better."

The crowd of Rebels stand, stunned, in a moment of silence. Then they all start nodding. "Y-yes, of course. You're right. Maybe we have been frivolous. I was... um... thinking of making some drastic changes."

"It sounds like you're scared. I get it. But, that's the price of putting yourself out there."

Stephan continues to talk some sense into the Meta-Rebels. By the time he's finished, you find that one of the crew has decided to join you on your mission.</text>

Your computer informs you this is the Wentworth Estate.
