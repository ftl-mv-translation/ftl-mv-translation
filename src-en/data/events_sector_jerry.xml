            <text>Without much difficulty, you manage to triangulate the source of the signal to a moon orbiting a gas giant. A small habitat dome is well hidden, with a Rebel Engineer ship docked.

"Hahaha! Alright, good boys and girls! Come and join Ellie's righteous crusade! Neeiiigh! For the happiness of all children, we will slaughter any who censors Ellie!" The Rebels practically kneel. Well, at least Ellie found some fans who are as looney as she is. There are several volunteers who fight for the chance to get on board, and many others offer as much scrap as they physically can.</text>

The Rebels have a momentary look of confusion as they realize who Stephan is. "Stephan? Visiting us? You know... I had always dreamed of meeting you. You could do a lot of good for our cause you know, getting the word out there-"

"Hold on - I'm going to cut you off there. Right now, I have a debt to repay the people on this ship. I think it's great that you're practicing your ideology, but... I don't think my show alone is going to do much good. There's so many more relevant changes you could make in Rebel space - stuff that might actually change things for the better."

The crowd of Rebels stand, stunned, in a moment of silence. Then they all start nodding. "Y-yes, of course. You're right. Maybe we have been frivolous. I was... um... thinking of making some drastic changes."

"It sounds like you're scared. I get it. But, that's the price of putting yourself out there."

Stephan continues to talk some sense into the Meta-Rebels. By the time he's finished, you find that one of the crew has decided to join you on your mission.</text>

	<text>A massive Rebel city has been constructed on the planet below. Somewhat off to the side is a massive villa, with lights so bright it hurts to look at them. Your computer informs you this is the Wentworth Estate. The Vance of this reality doesn't live here in practice of course, but if you had to guess, this is likely where his nephew is residing.</text>

Evacuate everyone and dispatch the security detail!" Immediately, a heavily armed Auto-ship is dispatched to handle you. Looks like you'll have to be quick about this!</text>

Among them are several armed Aces, a tall and imposing commander dressed in black garments with yellow stripes, and a scruffy looking civilian. The man in black is no doubt who you're looking for. As you approach the group they draw their weapons, and you draw yours.</text>
