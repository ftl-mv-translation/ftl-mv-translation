    <text>There's a Slug station at this beacon, and a fairly active one at that; you pick up tons of transmissions coming from it. It doesn't seem like they've noticed you yet. You tap into one of the many signals, and luckily, it seems they're all unencrypted.
        
"...yesss ma'am, our ssssoftware will keep your sssstuff safe. You're welcome, ma'am. Now, for payment, we actually only take Tony'ssss giftcardssss - it'ssss much more ssssecure than normal transsssactionsss..."
You swap to another transmission. "...long losssst relative of a prince of a remote ssssysssstem..." a Slug says in what sounds like an attempt at mimicking a Mantis, "and many goodiessss await you! Jusssst need identi-" You've heard enough to get a decent idea of what's going on here.</text>

        <event>
            <text>You carefully fly closer to the station. It takes little time for them to notice you, and very quickly all the transmissions go quiet. A hail follows after. "Hi, uh, Renegade. We're not up to anything at all. Nope. Not even a little. And even if we hypothetically were, you're not that attached to the Fedssss, right? Not that we are, but you'd let ussss go if we were. Hypothetically. In theory."</text>

            <text>Your Slug directs you to hail the station. The second they connect, they immediately start babbling in a croaky, frail voice. "Issss thissss the technology ssssupport center? My grandsssson found thissss sssship and it keepssss not working..."
			
Another Slug onboard the station responds with poorly concealed glee, apparently not caring that they're scamming one of their own. "Yessss, yesss, it issss. We can help, you jussst need to let ussss interface with your sssship."
			
Your Slug grins at you. "Oh, okay. What'ssss 'interface'?"

Your Slug spends the next while being as dense and obstructive as possible, talking in complete circles and generally being annoying. The scammer lasts for a surprisingly long time, but eventually, after your Slug asks what an engine is for the fifth time, he cracks. There's a banging noise over the comm punctuated by a scream of rage. "Sssstupid little- how isss it posssssible to be too dumb to sssscam? How can you even pilot that thing? AGHHH."</text>

                    <text>The comm cuts off and your Slug starts howling with laughter. Knowing you've done an incredible service - a.k.a. waste someone's time - you prepare to jump away. Right before you're about to, though, you watch as one of the airlocks on the station opens and a computer comes sailing out, with a schematic saved in it! It's not much, but it's honest work.</text>

    <text>There's a Knight ship hanging outside the nebula. Rather than making any motions to attack, the ship seems to ignore you. A private communication comes from within the ship.

Ivar laughs. "That's what the nameplate on my desk says!"

Ty nods. "Got it. You would, of course, be subjected to more scrutiny than an Oro'bache might. If you want to pursue that path, I'm certain it would look good if you would join the guard of the Gardenworlds."
