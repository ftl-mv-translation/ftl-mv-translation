	<text>You arrive to see a number of Rebel ships attempting to dissuade Lanius scavenger ships from "acquiring" their forward station. A passing Rebel patrol ship spots you and moves in to intercept.</text>
	<text>A Rebel scout patrols near the beacon. "Hah! I know you would try and sneak through this sector! You thought the Rebels wouldn't come here, did you? Well I've been waiting here for months, and now it has all paid off!"</text>
	<text>The Rebels will spare no race any mercy, not even one as menacing as the Lanius. Though they came here to hunt the deadly metal men, the Rebels are just as keen to fight you as well.</text> 
	<text>You arrive at the beacon and notice a small Rebel ship chasing Lanius scavengers away from a wrecked Rebel battleship. As soon as the Rebel notices you and moves in to attack, the Lanius ships return to their prey like flies on garbage.</text>
	<text>"It's awfully convenient that you've come here! I was given the horrible job of cleaning this sector of the Lanius, but perhaps killing you is the chance I need to be put somewhere else where our targets don't try to choke us to death!"</text>

	<text>It's a strange day when you can bet just as much on a hostile Pirate encounter as a Lanius one in the Lanius' Homeworlds. Had you gambled on the pirate, you could have made some nice money just now.</text>
	<text>Debris from a number of battleships are scattered around the beacon. As you approach the area a pirate ship thrusts itself through the hulks to attack. It must be using the metal to lure the Lanius into a trap.</text> 
	<text>The pirate ship patrolling this sector has been busy. The debris of several Lanius scouts and at least one civilian ship litter the area. "Welcome, welcome, there's room for one more!" The over-confident pirate hails you as he charges his weapons and moves in to attack.</text>
	<text>A pirate vessel is hunkered down at this beacon in wait of a victim to appear. Satisfied with your ship over some giant Lanius militarized convoy, they attack.</text>

In my immortality I have lived through the worst of those days. It is where I have learned to trust none but my own.

The repugnant 'Augmented' left on a great exodus to harness the power of the Forefathers. The rest, pure and clear minded, remained loyal to me. We do not speak of them unless we must. Be fortunate it is you who carried this gift. If it were them, I would have waged a war so great it would tear the galaxy in half.

It cannot be used responsibly! That was my belief, that I could only trust myself. If you purport to be strong enough to use this technology, yet wise enough not to fall into the same power madness as the others, perhaps friends we can be."
