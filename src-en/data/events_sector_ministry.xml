<event name="ZOLTAN_FASCISM" unique="true">
	<text>A few smouldering wrecks nearby are being observed by a Zoltan vessel, whose captain is speaking on open comms. At first you think he's blindly talking to himself until you realize he's speaking to you. "Damn Duskbringers, so much pointless bloodshed. This is all the fault of humanity, infecting this galaxy with their diseased ideologies like fascism. If it wasn't for the Rebellion, never would such sinister thoughts have reached our peaceful race."</text>
	<choice hidden="true">
		<text>That... doesn't sound right.</text>

			<text>"Oh but it is! It's an ideology born out of the stomach, used by jingoists and fake patriots alike to line pockets with war-time economy and supress free speech. It is a mockery of intellectualism and a cog in the eugenics machine." This guy isn't wrong, but the way he speaks makes you realize he may be a bit delusional.</text>
			<choice hidden="true">
				<text>If you hate fascists, maybe you can help us with the Rebels?</text>
				<event>
					<text>The Zoltan mumbles something to himself. "Fighting the Rebellion is a futile effort. The disease of fascism has already infected the galaxy, and there's no cure. But you seem young and hopeful. Perhaps a new generation of right-minded individuals can rectify the course of our politics." The Zoltan sends some equipment your way. "I've been holding onto this since the Civil War. I'm not a soldier anymore, I don't need it. Take it, and send the fascists packing!"</text>

The conclusion seems to be he's experiencing early cognitive decay, a rare malfunction in Zoltan chassis that can cause erratic thought patterns and irregular speech. However, trying to convince him to find a hospital only seems to confuse him more. Strangely, he thinks you're asking him for a reactor tune-up, and agrees.</text>

You have forever ruined this galaxy with partisan concepts like 'democracy' and 'feminism'. It disgusts me. We were once a pure race, until we came into contact with yours. It is known that humans are a warlike race who can only be controlled by manipulating their even greater greed. Take this, and never return."

			<text>"I'm afraid that's a lie. One of many. As you can see, we are not Zoltans in the same sense that you know. Long long before the Federation, all of us Zoltans looked this way. Back then, we were steaming ahead full force into the interstellar era, driven to be the first of many competing nations. But this competition turned to travesty, and nuclear holocaust became imminent. Osmia was annihilated, and the survivors were forced to flee the planet. For almost centuries Osmia was out of our reach, a solemn reminder of our failure."</text>
			<choice hidden="true">
				<text>Continue...</text>
				<event>
					<text>"The lost explorers roamed the surrounding nebula, unable to settle for long without devolving into war once again. However, in those mysterious clouds they found something. At the center of the infamous Great Eye nebula was a monolith that held immense, god-like power. The Zoltans came to worship it, and so it brought them unity. This gave birth to the Illesctrian faith and the Ministry who sought to uphold this new peace. The Ministry, however, was brutal with its enforcement, and to justify its cruelty the leadership constructed an ever-large and rapidly expanding codex of laws no man nor army could ever memorize. Through force they assimilated every last Zoltan colony."</text>
					<choice hidden="true">
						<text>But what happened? Why are the Zoltans hard-light now?</text>
						<event>
							<text>"Yes, see, the Great Eye also brought with it the discovery of other, similar tech. Aether, a highly conductive and resistant metal alloy used to forge the ruins around the Eye could be used to create sustainable hard-light generators. This tech enticed the Ministry's top scientists, who saw it as a solution for the Osmia crisis alongside various other tech. Though Aether was used to construct most of Zoltan kind's most infamous technology like our special shields, we also used it to create new part-organic part-mechanical forms to explore Osmia with. This was a success and the explorers were revered as heroes, and many flocked back to recolonize the planet. The current Minister at the time only lived for a little longer until he succumbed to a natural death and was replaced by the new Minister, Lumei."</text>
							<choice hidden="true">
								<text>Wait, but wasn't this centuries ago? How is Lumei still in charge?</text>
								<event>
									<text>"This was indeed long ago, but we'll get to the answer for your question soon enough. Under Lumei's leadership the codex was almost doubled in size and enforcement became even stricter. The Osmian explorers, still held high in reverency by the public, were given seats in the Ministry so Lumei could keep them close to him as pawns. Because of the connection between Aether and the Great Eye, these hard-light forms took on a religious significance as well, and so Lumei himself underwent transformation to secure his power. As the technology became better researched soon the wealthy elite, priests, and eventually even the common people were able to afford such procedures. Supremacy of the transformants took hold and, fearful that this divide might create a split between the Zoltans, the Ministry began to normalize and enforce transformancy."</text>
									<choice hidden="true">
										<text>Continue...</text>
										<event>
											<text>"Most adamant non-transformants died of natural causes and the newer more 'progressive' mindset took hold. All Zoltans over the age of 7 were to be immediately transitioned into hard-light chassis. The only place the Ministry struggled to touch was, ironically, Osmia itself. A group of non-transformants had taken hold there, seizing control of the territory between the wastelands that had survived the initial holocaust. Eventually the Ministry gave up and spent their effort erasing the importance of Osmia from the rest of the Zoltans - something made easier by the recent discovery of other sapient life. And so, that is how the first of we Osmians came to be. The Ministry wants nothing more than for the galaxy to forget we exist and for us to die out naturally."</text>

They were captured by the Ministry and kept locked away in a secret laboratory under 'protocol 3', in the case of an unforeseen cataclysmic failure of the hard-light forms. We estimate there's likely several hundred of them locked away from centuries ago - each of them an innocent life, as well as a time capsule for ancient forgotten history.

	<text>Your radar immediately picks up several more pings. You're afraid this means the Zoltans have received reinforcements - but this isn't the case. In fact, it's quite the opposite. The Osmians have arrived, and unlike most of your "allies" in conflicts like this, they're actually providing firepower from the sidelines!</text>

	<text>The Osmian troops, though limited in ships, are plentiful in manpower and storm the lab. The Zoltan scientists surrender. You take note of assorted Engi and even a few workers in Federation garb in the crowd, but you're distracted by Malki. "Thank you for your help. Though material offers I cannot extend, I can provide your Federation blueprints for our finest warship. We-" Suddenly, an alarm blares. Something bad is happening!</text>

			<text>Shortly after the alarm, another warning plays over the stereo. You might be getting tired of all these warnings, but this isn't one to be ignored. "Evacuate the premises immediately. Nuclear strike imminent." Panic immediately breaks out, and your radar detects an approaching warhead. Apparently, in case of emergency, the Ministry rigged this place to destroy itself. If your holopad's estimation is correct, you have 10 minutes before the impact.</text>

					<text>Your crew rush over to help, disengaging the pods from their holding compartments and carrying them over to the awaiting Osmian transport vessels. As the timer continues to tick down, you realize there's a much greater issue than the time limit - there isn't enough space for all of the specimens. Malki notices too and is dismayed. "What will we do now? There isn't enough time for multiple trips!"</text>

<event name="OSMIAN_LEAVE">
	<text>"Are you insane? We didn't come this far just to leave them behind! We- we have to rescue as many as we can!" You try to explain there isn't possibly enough time to move them all, but Malki won't listen. Eventually, through force, you manage to drag him back to your ship as the rest of the Osmians flee. Though you weren't able to save all of the specimens and the scientists are doomed, at least all of the Osmians and your crew were able to make it away safely.</text>

			<text>From the distance as you leave the planet behind you can see the flash of the detonation. In grim silence Malki watches, unresponsive. "I have failed my people. But... I should have known. The Ministry would sooner destroy its heritage than allow its people to see the truth. It's not like it matters to them. If they ever need new specimens they know they can just attack Osmia again. That lab was merely a formality. If news of our raid gets out at all, I'm sure it'll be spun as an accident, though even that is doubtful."</text>

					<text>"You think the Federation didn't know about us? I'm sure they've briefed all the rest that we're some dangerous threat. That way, if we ever tried to start another civil war, the Federation wouldn't hesitate to side with the Ministry. But that's besides the point... I shouldn't be so grim. We didn't save everyone - we couldn't have. But we still saved dozens of our people, and we may finally recover some of our lost history. But, as the leader of my people, I have failed to prepare us for such outcomes: I cannot return to Osmia. I humbly request that you accept my services, captain."</text>
