Despite perhaps your better judgement, you decide to land anyways, and trail your way towards the ship.

					<text>The Zoltan turns to you, and his composure changes from distraught to disheveled and angry. "Renegade pigs? Get out of here, this is hallowed ground!" You pocket your weapons and raise your arms, to signal you come in peace. The Zoltan sighs and goes back to staring at the unmarked graves.
						
"The Federation history books don't tell many stories of the Zoltans' involvement in Federation Wars. I think most people choose to believe we played little to no part at all. But hundreds of thousands, if not more, proud Zoltans gave their lives fighting for the Federation and the Galaxy in the Fed-Mantis War, the anti-Inquisitions, and the Civil War. And what thanks do they get? An unmarked grave here, on some moon in the middle of nowhere in a sector no one but monks visit. And the Ministry is fine with it. They'd prefer people forget our involvement in those wars, as part of their whole... 'non-violence' agenda." The Zoltan spits on the ground away from the graves. "It's shameful, really."</text>

The Ministry couldn't afford to keep sending troops when internal affairs were a mess and the Rebels always a threat, so they pulled the plug. And of course, when the war was over, the Zoltans were painted as cowards and traitors, unwilling to serve the very organization they had helped found." The Zoltan turns away from you and goes back to staring at the graves. With nothing else to add, you figure it's best to leave.</text>

As he wipes away a tear, he says, "T-thanks. I haven't known Renegades to be the sensitive type. Sensitive as in, situationally aware. But perhaps it's unfair to judge a book by its cover." He stands back up and sticks out his hand. "The name's Dovan. I joined the Duskbringers at a dark point in my life, when tensions between the Ministry and Union were at their highest, and everything about the Federation felt.. bleak. But now I realize it was all a mistake. The Federation, for all its flaws, is the only thing capable of uniting the galaxy. The Duskbringers, the Rebels, organizations like those... they're only going to tear this entire Multiverse apart. Do you mind if I go with you? My crew doesn't ever need to know..."</text>
