	<text>As yet another hostile Morph vessel approaches, you can't help but wonder if the Shells never actually finished "designing" their temperament. What else could explain how erratic they are?</text>
	<text>You receive a video with a gibberish title which shows several cartoon alien warriors fighting each other in gladiatorial combat. Minutes later, a Morph ship approaches, weapons on the ready.</text>
	<text>Something tells you the nearby Morph ship isn't friendly. It might be the aggressive shouting, or their charging weapons. Just a hunch, though.</text>
	<text>These aggressive Morphs really set a bad image for the rest of their kind. At least they don't yell "Hey, you're that Federation ship!" every time they see you.</text>
