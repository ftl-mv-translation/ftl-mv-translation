"Do you even remember that time on Argolida III - we were on the run, you recall - when we were out of supplies and I had to pull together some soup with the local cacti? Yes, we ended up drunk and confused and it tasted awful, but we were alive! We were surviving! Could you even conceive of doing that anymore?"
				 
				Sylvan Prime tries to interject again. "Lissssten, my Anurak-" Anurak cuts him off again. "Or do you remember that time when we were completely surrounded and you bargained your way out by turning the mercenaries - What were their names again? Harbo.... no, was it Derrinth? Yes, I think Derrinth was one of them. You turned Derrinth and what's-her-face against their employers by giving him your prized armchair and I think you gave that lady your drive core? You remember Derrinth, right? Died next year from a potassium overdose. Weird guy. The lady though, I don't think she even told us her name, she betrayed us like 3 days later anyway. That's the cost of dealing with people who would turn against their employers so easily, I guess. I wonder what happened to her."	</text>

Your favorite, you used to call them 'smeepberries'. Never told me why. My memory isn't always the best but I remember it clear as day - you would go 'Why don't you add ssssome more sssssmeepberriessss'. Always made Obyn laugh - some inside joke you never let me in on, I guess. Well, maybe there wasn't any more to it than that. You were a funny guy back then. Now look at you!

Thank you for freeing me, Renegade! Unfortunately, I can't stick around for long. I have some other business I need to take care of, but I'll be back soon to... handle this place. Hahe! Bye-bye!"

I come from another cluster entirely, one with very different properties from your own. The Multiverse is much, much bigger than you probably realize. This is why we invented the term 'cluster'. Clusters are nothing but an arbitrary classification, a way to organize realities that are barely distinguishable from each other."
							  /
							:)
							
							"But maybe you're wondering why this is all the way it is. Who are WE, exactly? Well, it's simple. Simple enough... One day, Prime and the other Sylvans took control of the Nexus through devious means. At first just a trade alliance, eventually they came to realize just how truly infinite and terrifying the Multiverse truly is. A mysterious entity invaded Prime's home cluster, and nearly triggered an event we refer to as R-Day. And so, the C.E.L. was born. To handle threats like that! It's a noble deed, but the agency is ran by a very unstable tyrant."

							<choice hidden="true">
								<text>But what role do we play in this?</text>
								<event>
									<text>"Oh, of course! Hahe! My bad. It's just... well it's not my favorite story to tell. You see, Prime is not the first to rule the Nexus. Long ago, this was my home. I am a very ancient being, something which long outdates the time in which your cluster achieved Multiverse travel. Against my better judgement, I let Prime enter the Nexus because he claimed to be an ambassador of a group of survivors closely linked to me - but instead, Prime merely tricked me."
									   /
									:(
	
									"When Prime had seized control over the Multiverse itself, I was enslaved to him. He divided my power among two containers, leaving only a third for me to control. The primary division of my power was placed in secret exile, but the second largest division is imbued in the special rings which Prime has that orbit him. Through this, he has not only become immune to my power - but the power of every agent within the C.E.L. as well. Now, he runs the show with no one who can stop him, and anyone who might is simply kept away. But now, things have changed. Prime did a good job convincing his agents this was all for the greater good once, and I don't even disbelieve he fell for his own lie... but no mortal can play god this long without inevitably falling victim to their own failings."
									   /
									:\

									"R-Day is not the only protocol the C.E.L. has. There are numerous catastrophic events in which the C.E.L. keeps a special eye out for. Among them is P-Day, perhaps the most... sensitive to Prime. One day, the enforcer named G-Van discovered a disturbing occurance in Cluster 363, which suggested that it had already befallen P-Day. A husk of what it once was, Prime took pity on the survivors once he realized the reality was so similar to his own. He offered a deal, and allowed a trio to scout out a new home for the refugees. However, when the P-Day event almost spread to an adjacent cluster, Prime panicked and pulled the plug. He condemned them all to die, and stranded the scouts in a foreign land with no help nor home. Fortunately, I was able to reach out to them, though it wasn't easy. But I can only help them so much, and there are many more who suffer under the iron fist of Prime. But... you can help!"

	<text>A nearby station is broadcasting a looping message advertising some kind of convention. "Come one, come all, any Ssssylvanssss not currently employed by the C.E.L. are welcome to participate in the weekly S.I.L.V.A.N. meeting! Sssylvansss of particularly ssspecial abilitiesss extra welcome!!!"</text>
	<choice hidden="true">
		<text>Visit the station.</text>

			<text>Before you're allowed to dock, you're hailed by yet another Sylvan. "Welcome, ssstranger. Before you can enter, we'd like to verify - you are a Ssssylvan, yesss? And not one of thosssse C.E.L. assssholesss, right?"</text>
			<choice hidden="true">
				<text>That's definitely us!</text>
				<event>
					<text>"Perfect, welcome aboard Ssssylvan!" Sylvan activates the docking port, allowing you to enter the station.
					
					You follow several signs that lead you to a large conference room filled with folding chairs, where several dozen Sylvans are sat making idle chatter. Several minutes after you enter, a Sylvan at the front of the room clangs a liquor bottle against the pulpit. "Hey! Everyone, lisssten to me! Guysss! I'm talking! SSSHUT THE HELL UP AND LISSSTEN TO ME GOD DAMN IT!" The room falls quiet as everyone turns to look at the Slug, who is now drinking from the bottle. "Hello everyone, Normal Ssssylvan here! Today I'll be presssenting the weekly S.I.L.V.A.N. addresssss. Like I alwaysss do, sssince I founded thisss organization." Normal Sylvan coughs and looks at a note card in his hand. "Unfortunately, Sssylvan from the reality where Sssylvan doesssn't exissst could not make it today. However, it ssseemsss we have sssome newcommersss!"
					
					It takes you a moment to realize Normal Sylvan is referring to you. "You, weird people in the back. Why don't you introduce yourssselvess and the uh... reality you come from. Make sssure you explain it nice and ssslow ssso everyone can underssstand it from their posssition in the plane of exissstence. Sssome people are alssso jussst ssstupid."</text>
					<choice>
						<text>Uhhh.... We're uh...</text>
						<event>
							<text>"Ssso you're from the reality where Sssylvan issss a moron. Got it. Now ssshut up and sssit down." Normal Sylvan claps, and a Sylvan dressed like a waiter appears, carrying a tray of apple slices. "Alright everyone, thankfully Child Ssssylvan'sss mother hasss prepared usss all complementary sssliced applesss to proceed the meeting with."
							A Sylvan in the back raises his hand, and Normal Sylvan groans. "Yessss, Apple Sssylvan, we prepared sssliced Ssslugsss for you to eat inssstead."
							
							"Now then, firssst order of busssinesss. We have identified the emergence of a new cataclysssm, one which the C.E.L.'s negligence hasss overlooked. Giant sssentient pea-podsss have taken over Reality-6783!"
							
							One of the Sylvans in the front of the room coughs, which seems to anger Normal Sylvan heavily. "Did I ASSSSK for your opinion, Ssssylvan from the reality where everyone isss a giant sssentient pea-pod? Your reality is weird asss hell, hah! Peas are grossss. And people don't even ssspontaneously catch fire when they sssay 'hypnotize'- AAAAAAAH!" Normal Sylvan spontaneously catches fire and falls off the stage, prompting chaos to break out in the room. One Sylvan in particular stands up to protest, "Why do we even come to thessse? We sstarted thessse becausssse we felt Prime wasssn't acknowledging our cluster'sss ssstake in thisss empire, but honessstly? Prime isssn't that bad. He doesssn't yell at usss, we live comfortably and he keepsss the Multiverssse ssafe!"
							The other Sylvans break out into furious debate with each other, throwing things across the room. Before you can even consider interrupting or leaving, a gigantic beam slices its way through the station, sending all of the chairs spiraling out into the abyss as well as a couple Sylvans until the repair gel springs into action.</text>
