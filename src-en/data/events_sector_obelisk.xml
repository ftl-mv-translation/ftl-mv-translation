									<text>The stocky build of a muscular and imposing man with two heavy duty blasters holstered at his hip materializes, presumably from a teleporter aboard the Flagship.

At least, from my perspective. Micro-cloning and stasis sleep can keep you ticking for years, but you better not be a vain person, because aging has its... effects. It certainly has on me."</text>

"There, the Queen is dead, and the Royals will fall. This bomb has a special date with an old friend of mine, so if you don't mind, I shall take my leave. Glory to the Rebellion."

If he knows what the Paragon is, then it's presumable he'll know how to construct and detonate it too. Even worse, as you watch the Flagship jump away, an advanced analysis of his MV drive shows he has one particular reality in mind - Universe 0, the first reality and home to the Federation's Multiverse fleet. If Vance can get there, he can wipe out that entire reality, damning the entire Federation across all realities!</text>
