									<text>The Dread Pirate Tuco, true to what the Outcast claims, is not so much a singular person but rather a title. The original Tuco from whom the moniker was derived lived during the days of the archaic Rock-Crystal Empire and fought against Toarde and the other 4 Rock Elders during the collapse of the Empire. While Tuco's side inevitably lost and the Theocracy rose from the ashes of that war, stories of the ventures of Tuco continued to be shared by Rock school-children even after the Elders forbade them from being told. Several Rockmen have picked up the title of Tuco since then, giving the name even more infamy and immortality. The current holder of the title is believed to once have been known as Rowbad, and currently works as a bodyguard for Ocym, the Aquarian co-founder of the Argeonn smuggler clan.</text>

	<text>"An excellent choice." The Outcast stretches out his arms to the crowd as you take a seat, then begins to tell his story. "Not too long ago, on the cusp of the revolution, protestors had begun to gather on Vrachos IV, the homeworlds of the Rock species and capital planet of the Theocracy! Though they started peacefully, Stonewall (the residing Elder and leader of the Inquisitions) would not dare have anyone question himself or the other Elders, and so he dispatched his Crusader forces to handle the crowds."</text>

Soon, the conflict grew so large that the Paladins from Numa V had to be called, a rare but significant show of force from the Elders. So numerous were the arrests made that it was clear executions would be inefficient, and so the leaders of the protests were killed and the rest exiled. Tuco, with nowhere left to go, journeyed with the countless thousands of other Outcasts to the Badlands, where they founded the first of the Outcast settlements that we live in today."</text>

"It is no secret that the Tiiikaka slavers are only present in our sectors because they have been employed by the Theocracy to capture our brothers and sisters for use in the Coalition construction yards. Tuco himself was one of the many victims of these raids, and so he was taken to the Tiiikaka camps. But Tuco cared not for chains and cuffs, and so at night he put together a resistance effort to defeat their cruel masters. This is where he adopted his title as Tuco, a codename between resistance coordinators so as not to leak the identities of those involved.</text>

He returned to the Badlands, and together with the forces of Admiral Ariadne of the Lost Sun fleet drove Tiiikaka from the Badlands once again. Tuco stayed with us Outcasts for some time until he grew restless, and once again departed to seek greater adventures in the starry beyond!"</text>

A life of quiet complacency within the Theocracy, and months trapped in a filthy cell in a Tiiikaka slave camp had filled him with a deep yearning for adventure. Fear not, for the great Tuco lives on to this day! They say he works a position of protection for Ocym, founder of Argeonn! Tuco has not abandoned us yet brothers and sisters - never fear. Before he left, he made a promise that should the Badlands ever be under threat again, we only need to call him back and he will come."</text>

	<text>"Can it be true? To hear a new story of the Dread Pirate... it is an honor!"
	
	Tuco takes out a stringed instrument. "Feel free to join along. Personally, I say any story should have a proper soundtrack, you hear?" The other Rocks nod as they start to take out instruments of their own - percussion, horns, wind.
	
	"Any thoughts on a track we could play?" The other storyteller asks.
	
	"I was thinkin', something similar to 'The Rupture of Delta Gorno'? Sound good?" The others nod their heads in agreement.  "One, two, three, four." The rocks begin to play their instruments, and the SSLG clap along. "My friends, the Hive, she knows no depth to her voracious appetite. That queen, those insects... they'll fight for anything they can get their sharp little legs on, and stab anyone they need to keep it. Many 'a Rock has become one of their slaves toiling away in the mines of Viiikaliraaako. Anyone?"
	
	"A sister." One of the Rocks working a bongo mutters gruffly.
	
	"A sister. Being forced to create wealth for a tyrannical queen bug. Oh, the wealth of those awful mines. And does the Hive deserve a smidgen of it?"
	
	"No!!"
	
	"No! Of course not, so I'll tell you what I did. Me and my crew, we took my good ol' dusty cruiser and I thought I'd teach 'em a lesson. Once a week, they load up all that filthy lucre into a convoy and send it back to their nest. Well, I'm no stranger to a risky strategy, so I'll tell you what I did. My friends had come into possession of a fancy Union transport. All we had to do was make them think it was full of useful and talented slaves. Once they had come within a jump of it, we activated its distress call and waited. Like clockwork, two of the Suzerains peeled off to investigate. Right into the minefield we'd left for them. That left only two of them versus my one, single ship. But you all know me, that's more than a fair fight as far as I'm concerned! We fended off those Mantises, two to one! The battle was glorious... and the treasure was all ours!"
	
	"What did you do with the bounty?"
	
	Tuco stops strumming. "Well... gambling and drinking, mostly." The crowd gives a raucous laughter.

Very boring political stuff, you wouldn't care much about it. But what you might care about is a job offer! I am in need of an escort. As you can see, my ship is very poorly armed.

There shall be harsh consequences for these actions."</text>

I needn't waste your time with much historical mumble, but in short the Empire has been so tolerant of the SSLG's more radical motions as the Empress sees great benefit in gaining access to Theocracy grounds. We seek access to the Waystone, the device originally used to seal our homeworlds away from the galaxy. At first, we hoped the Lost Suns might retrieve it for us in return for more dedicated support.

	<text>Before you is a grand spectacle, a giant sprawling city so tall it blocks out the sun. Massive bridges span artificial ravines with walls lined with store fronts. Half of the city seems to resemble traditional Rock architecture, but many connected segments are only half complete and are seemingly cobbled together out of scrap metal. This is Turban, one of the largest centers for trade, commerce, and culture in the modern galaxy, created quite ironically from the former site of a Chrysolic Church and Inquisition stronghold.</text>

My father sat at the table of victors when the Elders divided the Rock-Crystal Empire and seized power, but he was denied a place as an Elder.

She was but a young child at the time, but what were we to do? The Rock people hated us, they saw us as exactly what we were. My daughter hated me too, and one day she simply vanished from her room in Toarde's palace along with her brother. Toarde was furious, and he blamed me because he had no one else to blame."</text>

I had helped in the planning for the original construction of Turban before it was abandoned, you see. After the outcasts had established full control I was allowed to stay, but they began to call me the 'cursed one'.

			<text>It seems the Theocracy's mission is complete, even if some survived. Most of the ships have jumped away, and visibly the survivors managed to scrape through the fire-fight. Among them is Argo, carrying a bloodied staff typically carried by priests such as he used to be. "I am in no way qualified to speak in such manners, but I think it goes without saying we people of Turban thank you. We Outcasts never expected the Federation to aid us in such a way. Assuming it has survived the bombardment, you should find a Rock cruiser on the landing pads outside of the city. It belongs to me, but I want you to have it. I must stay here and help repair the city. Turban will stand once again, I am certain of it."</text>
