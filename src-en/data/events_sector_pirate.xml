            <text>Tuco chuckles as he brings the scrap back to his ship. "Good fightin' there kid. Couldn't have done it better myself. SO, I'll tell you what; this hunk o' junk that I'm disgraced to call my personal cruiser has seen much better days. So how 'bout I hitch a ride on that pretty ship o' yours, and you do whatever you'd like with mine."</text>

			<text>Despite all the damage caused in the fight, the yacht owners are extremely grateful for your help. "That idiot has been a regular for years, and he's always causing issues. It's about time he got what was coming to him. Pffft, dread pirate my ass. As generous payment, please accept this scrap and a few of our slot machines!" You aren't sure what you think about the unusual reward, but you aren't going to turn it down.</text>
