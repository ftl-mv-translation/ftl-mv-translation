	<text>An MFK Ace ship is conversing with a transport, surprisingly not on an encrypted frequency. However, it seems obvious why. They're talking of nothing important, and you consider just passing them by, when suddenly the conversation shifts. The MFK, addressing the transport's captain, asks, "So, you're heading to the Protectorate, right?" The transport captain nods, briefly taking a cigarette out of his mouth to let out a simple "Yessiree".</text>

		<text>The "Protectorate"? Keep listening...</text>
		<event>
			<text>The Ace leans in closer, eager to pry more details from the captain. "Really now? You gotta tell me what goes on in there. Years ago, Vance brought this scruffy little blonde kid to training, said he was his nephew or somethin'. He was some 3 years our junior, but he kicked every Ace's ass in combat practice, then waddled off to go draw a horse with some crayons on the wall. Then one day, Vance came back and yanked the kid. Don't know what happened to him, but I heard after director Black retired, Vance put her in the Protectorate to watch over his nephew."</text>
			<choice>
				<text>Continue...</text>
				<event>
					<text>The other Rebel captain nods, but the look on his face suggests he's growing impatient. "Yeah, yeah. Okay, cool exposition. But why are you telling me this? Aren't you supposed to be off, I dunno, killing Feds? I got a job to do buddy, I can't sit here on my ass all day. Get to the point." The Ace shrugs, displeased about his tone. "Look, what I'm asking for is some... you know, inside info? Surely, you got some if you go to and from that place all day."</text>

						<text>Continue...</text>

							<text>The captain shakes his head. "First off, anything I could tell you, I can't. Closed lips on all that jazz. Second off, I don't know shit either. All I'll say is this - rumors are right about Cyra running the place, and she keeps a tight ship. I've never been past the wall. Well, a glimpse. But it's nothin' special. Now, get out of my way." The MFK Ace is indignant that even he has been refused information, but he only growls and moves his ship out of the transport's way. If you want to pursue this, now's your chance.</text>
