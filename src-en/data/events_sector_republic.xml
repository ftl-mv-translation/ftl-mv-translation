You try to tell the salesman that you'll still buy it if it's orange. "No no, listen to me. It would be just a bit too orange for your taste. You'd better get something better." You tell him that it's okay, you still want to buy it. "I'm afraid you don't understand. It's far too orange for the likes of you." You insist that you don't care about how orange it is. "Well... You have to realize. It's... STAGGERINGLY orange. Like, more orange than you could even believe. If I sold you this, you would punch my lights out." You insist that color doesn't matter and you just want to buy it. "Well, if you insist... Oh shoot. I just checked, and it's broken. Sorry. You'll have to buy something else."</text>
    <text>"What's that? Sorry, I don't think I'm familiar with that one." You try describing the weapon, but you only get a blank stare in return.</text>
    <text>"You know what? We actually do have one of those, but it's been reserved by one of our other loyal customers. You understand, right?"</text>
    <text>"Ah, bad luck! Out of stock. The next batch is supposed to show up in like, four hours. Sorry about that."</text>
    <text>"Oh, oops. We have a full shipment of it, but I left them in my garage back home. Clumsy me!"</text>
    <text>"I don't order those anymore. You know, they use unsafe labor practices to make those... or at least, that's what my customers tell me. And the customer is always right!"</text>
    <text>"Oh, you know what? I used to have a manufacturer for those, but they went out of business. I never managed to find someone else to buy those from. Maybe you'll take something else?"</text>
    <text>"Yeah, we have that. Let me go find it." The leech leaves to go back into the store room. Several minutes later he comes back empty handed. "It seems like I might have misplaced it. My bad!"</text>

The crowd joins in, chanting and practically drooling at the mouth for the prospect of killing the former President. In one final effort, Tyrdeo turns to you, pleading.

You're just another corrupt, power hungry wannabe trying to seize power through force!" cries one angry bystander, and the rest agree. Soon the mob has swarmed Alkram and things turn bloody. In the chaos, Tyrdeo breaks free and rushes over to you. "I might faint. I haven't been this terrified in all my life. I've soiled myself! Oh wait, sorry, you didn't need to know that. Anyways - please, take me with you! I can do more than trim hedges, I promise!" You agree, but before you can make it back to the ship, Tyrdeo ducks back into his palace and returns with his bird which he loads into the cargo. What a strange, strange man.</text>
