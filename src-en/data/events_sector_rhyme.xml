	<text>As the gigantic black vessel begins to dissipate, you hear The One Who Rhymes scream. "No, no, this cannot be! It's coming apart from the seams! You've ruined everything, you've crushed our dreams! I can feel myself fading, oh god I'm done! I can't... I can't believe you've really won." The entity fades away, as does the darkness around you.
	
	It's over. You've defeated Her, and saved the Multiverse from falling into the clutches of an eldritch god. It wasn't your initial mission - but what you've done here matters so much more.</text>
