	<text>"Oh grandfather Aneidio, if only thou could witness me now! Y-you. You are not worthy of a title. You have ascended past such mortal things. You have but completed in such short time what the legacy of all 16 Reapers could never. What are you? I dare not insult you with conjecture. But if you should accept my humblest opinion, then hark and listen. This Paragon, oh foul creation, is a tool of the Obelisks. An antithesis to their power yes, but of their making. Should it not seem to you most cruel after all of this to give them their way and let it be their invention that divide reality? The Obelisks will fall, but the Multiverse is a fact of our existence. Would it not be sorrowful to deprive reality of such a beautiful thing, to defile nature once again with the patent of cruel gods? Think these thoughts I ask of you, but do not let me be the one to stop you."</text>

I have SEEN the Ember spirits with my own eyes and I have killed them with my hands. How could a god bleed? Divinity is a lie. I cannot live with myself. I have led so many men and women astray, I have poisoned the masses with tainted lies. Yes, I believed them too, but if fate was not the one that put me there, then it was my own hubris. I ask you one final favor. I do not care what you do with the Paragon, it's far beyond my worries. But if we live past this day, take mercy on me and see to it I never return to my home. Cast me into the abyss before you sentence me to looking into the eyes of my victims once more."</text>

	<text>The shockwave of the bomb spreads further outwards, first consuming your ship, then the entire Obelisk Homeworlds, erasing every last Obelisk and Vance's entire fleet. Around the Multiverse, billions of MV drives ceased functioning, much to the confusion of everyone. Inevitably, the Federations and Rebellions of many realities were able to work out a truce, knowing the lopsided balances of power would only spell the end for them both. Though your sacrifice will never be known, you've put an end to the unending war, and restored every reality back to the way they were before.</text>

	<text>With the Paragon destroyed, you return to the Obelisk Homeworlds. The MFK Fleet awaits you, but when you show them the wreckage of their Flagship, they stand down. Even afterwards, the tales of your victory are spoken around the Multiverse. It seems your victory has earned you more than just another day to live - you'll forever be immortalized as the single ship that stopped the entire Rebellion. Without the original Vance, the many Rebellions of each reality struggled to gain leadership, and inevitably it spelled doom for the Rebellion. Their society collapsed, and the Federation quickly retook as many realities as they could. Though the conflict will inevitably continue for an eternity, at least things have calmed down at last.</text>
