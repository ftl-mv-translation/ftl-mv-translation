The nebula gasses have coalesced into an accretion disk, which may give sensors enough breathing room to function properly. The speed at which the gasses are travelling creates periodic waves of heat. At the same time, your ship's hull begins to buckle under the intense gravity. Spacetime itself warps around you, causing the color spectrum to shift to and fro. Before you even get close to the science vessel you're supposed to save, another ship intercepts you. An orange Zoltan broadcasts a message. "Another foe? How enjoyable. Perhaps this one will engage in bloodthirsty combat instead of cowering in a deep orbit. Well, interloper?
