	<text>The Rock citizens are perhaps some of the best armed civilians of any race. Unfortunately, that means just about every ship you encounter here is more than willing to engage you in a brawl.</text>
	<text>You've stepped foot in the Rock Homeworlds, the highly valued sanctuary for the Rock people. It is no wonder that the irate citizens of this sector seek your destruction so eagerly.</text>
	<text>"This one, he is not covered in stone! We shall cut off his head, and mount it to our wall as a trophy!" It doesn't seem the Rockmen here are willing to negotiate.</text>
	<text>There is a very thin line between civilians and military in the Rock Homeworlds. It's hard to tell the origins of the ship here, but nevertheless they're hostile and looking for a fight.</text>
	<text>Your very presence in this sector is a tremendous insult to Rock-kind. The Rockmen in the nearby system aren't pleased with your presence and decide to deal with you themselves.</text>
	<text>Rockmen aren't particularly friendly, but you know you've made a real mistake coming here when the civilians near this beacon go out of their way to initiate combat with you.</text>
