	<text>You catch chatter on the nearby Rock ship. In a hush tone, they speak of your ship and what vile sins must be committed aboard it. Eager to enact out the Elders' law, they power up weapons and attack!</text>
	<text>The Rock citizens are perhaps some of the best armed civilians of any race. Unfortunately, that means just about every ship you encounter here is more than willing to engage you in a brawl.</text>
	<text>You've stepped foot in the Rock Homeworlds, the highly valued sanctuary for the Rock people. It is no wonder that the irate citizens of this sector seek your destruction so eagerly.</text>
	<text>"This one, he is not covered in stone! We shall cut off his head, and mount it to our wall as a trophy!" It doesn't seem the Rockmen here are willing to negotiate.</text>
	<text>There is a very thin line between civilians and military in the Rock Homeworlds. It's hard to tell the origins of the ship here, but nevertheless they're hostile and looking for a fight.</text>
	<text>Your very presence in this sector is a tremendous insult to Rock-kind. The Rockmen in the nearby system aren't pleased with your presence and decide to deal with you themselves.</text>
	<text>Rockmen aren't particularly friendly, but you know you've made a real mistake coming here when the civilians near this beacon go out of their way to initiate combat with you.</text>

Seven years ago, he was in a company meeting alongside a Zoltan envoy named Tintan, when a Slug vessel arrived and deployed a 'prank' on the meeting, melding the two into one being against their will. As you can understand, reversing this has been a top priority for both Rig and Zulfiqar for the past seven years, but nothing we have attempted since has worked, and Rig's vitals - or rather, Tintan's, are showing signs that she is growing dangerously unstable over time, and may be at risk of detonation.

I hoped to change that by expanding into genetic experimentation; what army could turn down Mantises with the durability of a Rock? I met with representatives from Zulfiquar to discuss how we'd go about securing test subjects, then a Slug ship arrived and... demonstrated my ideas on them. The surgeons had no idea how to handle the situation. Tony's eventually went galactic when we started the loan program, but I never forgot about you, Rig."</text>

This city, the capital of the Rock civilization, is one of the only few that remains populated. It is under strict control by one of the five Rock Elders, Stonewall.
