	<text>You cross paths with an advance scout of the Rebel fleet searching this section of the nebula for your ship.</text>
	<text>A ship bearing Rebel colors can be seen waiting near the beacon. They must have been waiting for you, since they engage immediately.</text>
	<text>The Rebels must have anticipated you would try to lose them within the nebula. A scout is waiting for you at the beacon.</text>
	<text>It looks like you will be unable to avoid the Rebels by traveling through the nebula. A Rebel ship is waiting for you near the beacon.</text>
	<text>Shortly after you arrive, a Rebel ship jumps nearby. There looks to be no escape. Prepare for a fight!</text>
	<text>Newton-knows what brings this Rebel ship so far out; its captain hails, but does a double take when he identifies your ship. They open fire.</text>
	<text>A Rebel ship hails, but you don't take chances in conditions like this. You block the frequency and prepare to engage.</text>

	<text>You cross paths with an advance scout of the Rebel fleet searching this section of the nebula for your ship.</text>
	<text>You jump into a calmer part of the nebula. However, your relief fades as a Rebel scout jumps to the beacon and moves in to attack.</text>
	<text>The tangled wrecks of many ships wait in dormancy here. You see lights flicker on what looks like debris. A Rebel scout bursts out of the wreckage!</text>
	<text>This drone isn't looking for you. Perhaps it's scouting ahead for the Rebel expansion or maybe they're seeking to use this nebula for cover. Regardless, it identifies you as hostile.</text>
	<text>It's worrying that the Rebels have penetrated so deep into uncharted space, even if it is only an unmanned craft. It arms its weapons; you should do the same.</text>

	<text>As you drift through the nebula an unmarked vessel descends from the clouds and into your wake. Their weapons come online.</text>
	<text>A pirate ship pulls out of the ether and hails: "You know what I love about this part of the galaxy? The explorers! You always carry such fine loot." They lock weapons.</text>
	<text>As you coast through the nebula a pirate ship matches your course and closes the distance. Better to pick your battleground, but beggars can't be choosers.</text>
	<text>A hostile vessel descends from out of the nebula. Combat stations!</text>
	<text>You try to read the ID of a ship ahead in the fog, but it's too thick to penetrate. You have your answer when the ship turns, weapons hot!</text>

<event name="NEBULA_ENCOUNTER_SUN" unique="true">
    <text>It seems that the nebula here has condensed into a newly born star. It's quite the spectacle... but also very deadly. A Slug vessel is admiring the star, but upon seeing you decides to attack instead!</text>
