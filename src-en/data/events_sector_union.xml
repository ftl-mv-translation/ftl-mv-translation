	<text>As is customary in Union space, several corporate advertisements from the planet nearby play over your radio. You listen to them idly as you browse the nearby shipyards, gazing at various antique vessels. One in particular catches your eye, a Kestrel in seemingly full working order! You don't get to look at it very long though, when one of the advertisements catches your ear. It seems one from "Dewey Alms", CEO of Archive Incorporated, has an outgoing request for any capable mercenary vessel.</text>

<event name="KESTREL_UNLOCK_OFFER">
	<text>It seems these shipyards are in fact owned by Archive, so it's not difficult to get in touch with a correspondant who patches you in to Dewey directly. "Renegades? I have experience with your types. Before we begin, I would like to make it clear that, while I might be the CEO of Archive Inc., in this request I am not speaking on behalf of the company in any way. It would be... bad PR to get involved with more inter-dimensional Renegades after the disaster of the 'Rusting Hulks' incident. I'm sure you understand."</text>

		<text>We do.</text>
		<event>
			<text>"Good, good. Heh, don't worry. We aren't skirting the Union's laws or anything with this. I just don't want any backlash from a personal affair. As you may or may not already know, Archive specializes in the... well, archival of Antiquum Terrae (or as you might know it, Old Earth) technology and culture. This matter concerns one of my most prized antiques, a 23rd century 'Kasparov', the first FTL-capable ship produced by humankind. Originally made to transport passengers to and from Tau Ceti. A remarkable achievement... but she has been stolen by pirates! I can't gather why... sure, she marks a new age in exploration and discovery, but why would a pirate want such an outdated piece of technology?"</text>

My request; hunt down those thieves and secure the Kasparov. I haven't in mind any particular reward, but I'm sure we can work something out. Name your price."</text>

One last thing - I've programmed the coordinates for the pirate ship into my assistant, Gana. He's just a machine, and not a very personable one at that, but he'll be sufficiently useful in combat. Best of luck captain. Godspeed!"</text>
