    <text>Pinnacle Robotics facilities like the one near this beacon are notorious for wreaking havoc on unprepared ships passing by, as EMPs used to disable their experimental Sentient Weapons often overwhelm the planet's magnetosphere. It might be inconvenient, but the energy readings from this beacon should throw the rebels off your trail for a while.</text>
    <text>Your sensors are overwhelmed with traffic at this beacon, as Archive, Inc. ships work to restore ancient ruins recently identified nearby. The fleet will put a stop to all their work shortly, but the traffic should cover your tracks for now.</text>
    <text>You're treated to quite a sight as you drop out of FTL - R.S.T. workers are hard at work testing a new version of their terraforming technology on a planet nearby, with dust clouds rising up to the edge of the planet's atmosphere. You change your jump signature to match one of the ships observing from the beacon - that should keep the rebels off your tail a little longer.</text>
    <text>Detritus Disposal is apparently up to something exciting out here - an abandoned colony destroyed in the Federation-Mantis war is apparently slated to be recycled whole in a test for their A.C.I.D. tech's newest iteration. The array of ships hovering nearby to watch the destruction should prove a useful cover for your ship's movements from this beacon.</text>
    <text>This beacon is heavily trafficked by numerous civilian vessels of varying origins. Your radio is overcome with a spectrum frequencies that make it impossible to eavesdrop on any pertinent conversations, but at least, the Rebels will struggle to track you amongst the sea of vessels.</text>

I have experience with your types. Before we begin, I would like to make it clear that, while I might be the CEO of Archive Inc., in this request I am not speaking on behalf of the company in any way.

This matter concerns one of my most prized antiques, a 23rd century 'Kasparov', the first FTL-capable ship produced by humankind. Originally made to transport passengers to and from Tau Ceti.
