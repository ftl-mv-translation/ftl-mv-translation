The Federation-Mantis War, the Inquisitions, the Civil War, and a couple smaller ones you aren't too familiar with. Tully spots you looking at them and says, "I've started colecting documentaries on the wars I've lived through out of curiosity. You'd be amazed how wildly inaccurate some of them can be." 
		
	Tully picks up a rather provocatively titled one called 'The Red Menace: Earth's Last Stand'. "I mean seriously, this one uses footage of Coalition Bombers when the Coalition didn't form until after the Civil War! And it claims the Mantis were using clone armies! Cloning technology wasn't invented until several decades later, and it was by the Shells! There has never been a clone army deployed in all of our known galactic history!"</text>

Funny thing is, I gave him a nickname. Freddy. Ain't that such a coincidence?" Freddy nods his head. "Oh, ain't that swell! What a coincidence indeed. You ever met him again after you were rescued by the Feds?" Tully shakes his head and Freddy frowns. "Oh, well that's just a shame. Maybe some day you'll meet him again?" Tully shrugs.

Tully realizes his error and puts his palms on Turzil's shoulders. "No no, I didn't mean like that! It suits you, buddy! Some time you gotta teach me how to paint, alright?"
Turzil seems to shrink a bit. "Y-you want me to -teach- you how to paint? Together? Privately?"

Both pause when they see each other, and Tully's hand inches closer to his rifle. The cameras experience some interference as Alkram begins to build a slow electric charge. The two stare at each other, both ready to draw, frozen in place. The standstill finally comes to an end when the microwave beeps, signifying Tully's pasta meal is ready. He sighs and abandons his gun, and Alkram calms down as well. Though no words are ever exchanged, they share a nod of mutual agreement and sit at opposite tables to eat.</text>

"Okay... cool I guess? I can't say I understand, but it's good to see you again. I saw your speech. I don't know if the Federation would be inclined to forgive you for betraying them initially, but I for one am glad to have you back.</text>

	<text>Before he started travelling the Multiverse himself, Haynes used to live on Earth. However, he had to leave his home behind when Archive Inc. could no longer hold back the Vek threat. It's quite the sad story, and his isn't the only one like it out there.</text>

<event name="SOCIALIZE_HAYNES_GENERIC_3" unique="true">
	<text>"My parents were huge history buffs. Everyone who lived in Archive was. Makes sense, it's even in the name. There's some famous runes about a guy named Sherlock Holmes who lived in the ancient empire of Britannia who could solve any mystery.

There can only be one 'greatest detective'."</text>

Great deductive skills though! No no, tobacco's quite rare now that Earth's flooded and the drug market's saturated with all kinds of Slug junk. The pipe was a gift from my grandfather, who got it from his grandfather, who got it from his... and so on. They say it belonged to a guy named... er... Star-line? Stelen? Oh, father would be so disappointed in me for forgetting. Either way, it's a precious heirloom. I hate to admit it, but it's kind of fun chewing on the end. Clearly grandfather agrees, because there were toothmarks even before my own."</text>

Expecting intruders of some sort of worse, someone's fingers falling off from another space plague, instead you find Haynes screaming like a child in a corner of the ship as a tiny arachnid scuttles around on the floor. Carefully, he draws his blaster and aims it at the bug, blasting it to smithereenes. Only after it's dead does he see you watching him, and meagerly slinks away in shame.</text>
</event>
<event name="SOCIALIZE_HAYNES_GENERIC_6" unique="true">
	<text>You find Haynes contemplating something in his quarters. "There was a time I might have considered myself a patriot. Now, I'm not capitalist nor a warm-blooded Unionite, but I was proud of, if nothing else, the raw achievement and progress the Human race was able to accomplish against all the odds. Most species have some access to Aether or were from a time when Aether was still being made, but Humans? We paved our way all on our own. And we used to be grateful to be a part of the galaxy! The Engi, the Zoltans, they were our friends! We fought arm in arm against the Hive, but that BASTARD Vance had to change everything! And his cohorts, Tanaka and Stimly, god what I wouldn't give to be the one to put lead in all three of their skulls. I doubt anyone need to tell you this, but the Rebellion is the scourge of the galaxy; I can only hope the Union will some day get past this and we can all see the Rebellion for what it really is. It's not a glorious movement of human progress - it threatens to set the whole damn Multiverse back to the metaphorical stone age."</text>

<event name="SOCIALIZE_HAYNES_GENERIC_7" unique="true">
	<text>"You ever wonder what becomes of the people in the cases you solve? Well, I guess you wouldn't. But as a detective, I can't help but think about it. I think about it a lot, actually. Poor Amy and Daniel, not only did they have to deal with the death of their coworker and the arrest of another, but the twist they were working with two spies at once." Haynes sits down in a nearby chair and pulls out his pipe and goes to light it, only to remember he doesn't smoke. "God. Maybe I'm just stupid, you know? Even the greatest detective in the Multiverse can be an idiot sometimes. Worrying about nonsense like this when so much more is at stake."</text>
</event>
<event name="SOCIALIZE_HAYNES_GENERIC_8" unique="true">
	<text>As you approach, Haynes smoothens out his jacket and straightens his hat. "You know, it's the outfit that makes the man!" He contemplates that piece of wisdom for a moment, shrugs, and walks off.</text>

	<text>You find Haynes reading a book titled "A Study in Scarlet", which he closes when he spots you. "Ever wonder why it is people call me by my last name?

Oh well."</text>

He's a pretty good shot, but those bullets have to go somewhere - and you don't like the number of holes you've been noticing around the ship lately.

Halfway hidden behind his door and quivering slightly, Haynes asks what 'inquiring' Freddy is refering to. "Ah yes, well, I was wondering how much you knew about what I believe is the mythological empire of Britannia. Is it true they were said to wear hats like mine, and had delightfully posh accents?"
Haynes seems confused. "Well, for one, Britannia was real. It's not a myth. As for the hats, I couldn't tell you. The only surviving photographs are during some ancient wars, nothing of regular day attire. Is that everything?"

	<text>Jerry comes stumbling out of his room, an odd moment in which he isn't wearing his glasses and his hair is even more of a mess, and approaches you.

	<text>You notice an Equinoid plushie in the back of Jerry's quarters and decide to ask him about it. "Oh, well I got that a long time ago when I was just a little kid! My uh... my mother... she always said I got my love of Equinoids from my father. Not that I ever really knew him, but you know. When I was young I used to watch the 'Ellie the Equinoid' show almost daily! Man, the guy who played Ellie sure was dedicated to his role. Oh! And for my 7th birthday, Vance had some guy dress up as Ellie and come to my birthday party! Though, Vance never liked Ellie... or Equinoids. As a kid I never really got it, but now I feel like it was some weird personal grudge."
	
Jerry shrugs. "Either way, that plushie is old. I've had it since before I was even in Vance's custody. I had a blowout with my uncle one time when I refused to kill some Equinoids on a hunting trip, and he was... well he was pretty mad. I was so scared I hid all of my Ellie stuff under the floorboards so he couldn't take it away! Not that I think he ever would have. For as much as he hated Ellie, he loved me more..."</text>

<event name="SOCIALIZE_JERRY_GENERIC_4" unique="true">
	<text>"It was always uncanny, everywhere I went in the Protectorate people would follow me. If I was ever in front of a crowd, no matter what I said they'd always cheer for me. People would come up to me in the streets and push past my guards, just for a chance to shake my hand or ask me something. There was one girl who kept at it though: I couldn't tell if she was a stalker or... I don't know. I can't really remember her name but I think it started with an 'L'? I thought she was just some soldier, but Sebastian said apparently her father's rich. Like, really rich. I kind of miss all that praise though... but uh, well it was never really earned. I don't want to be cheered on for things my uncle did, good or bad. I want to be cheered for things I've done. Maybe some day I'll be more than just the Admiral's nephew..."</text>

	<text>"I've been to Universe 1 a couple times. Never longer than a week, and the tour was kept pretty tightly bound. It's... it's..." Jerry seems at a loss for words. "It's very... industrial. It didn't feel like a place people lived in. Yet, they do. Trillions. A whole galaxy's worth of humans. Everywhere was either too pristine to the point of sterile, or was some automated death machine factory. Safe to say, I didn't like it there. The Rebellion has changed. I was too young to really remember the original civil war, but it couldn't possibly have been like this? Who would have supported it? Who DOES support it?"</text>

My uncle told me the Engi don't even understand the concept of democracy, or civil rights, or... anything the Federation seems to stand for! The Engi remind me of the Rebellion... one species, totalitarian, and terribly unimaginative outside of creating new death machines. Why would you allow them into the Federation?"</text>

					<text>"So... so if the Rebellion was willing to talk peace, and to stop fighting, you'd let them into the Federation? And the Hive, and the Theocracy, and everyone else? The Federation banished the Slugs once, surely they can do it again with the Engi!" Jerry seems genuinely confused but doesn't want to risk asking more questions right now. He wanders off instead to ponder the situation.</text>

			<choice hidden="true">
				<text>I don't understand it either.</text>

If the Engi don't even fight for the Federation, how can you trust them?" Jerry seems genuinely confused, and totally oblivious to the influences of his uncle playing over him.

Vance said I should be proud to be a Wentworth, and not a... whatever my father's name was. When my mother divorced him, she changed her name back to Wentworth."

	<text>Nights stumbles into the cafeteria, bottle in hand, smiling wide and smugly. This isn't the first time it's happened - he does this whenever he's come up with some new brilliant joke. Everyone turns to look at him, except Jerry who's engrossed in a book he's reading.
"E-Everyone! *hiccup* In honor of the good Rebel Admiral, I've written him a poem!" Nights clears his throat and pretends to read from a scroll. "There once wassss an Admiral Vanccce, who took a career-changing chancccce! Fought the hive in a war, and they made him quite sssore, and now nothing remainsss in hisss panccce!"
	
Everyone in the room groans, and Jerry winces. Nights seems to accept this as a call for more and slides up to Jerry. "Hey kid, do you know what a pen isss?" Jerry, utterly confused and very uncomfortable, nods his head. "Uh... yes?"
Nights spreads his arms wide and exclaims "Well hey, at leasssst *hiccup* one Wentworth doessss! HAHAHAHAHAHAH HAAAAH HAAAHAHAHA! IT'SSSS FUNNY- IT'SSSS FUNNY BECAUSSSSE HE HASSSS NO-"
	
Jerry suddenly jumps down his chair and grabs Nights, hoisting him off the ground and shaking him.

YOU ARE THE REASON THE REST OF THE GALAXY SEES THE SLUG SPECIES AS NOTHING BUT A WORTHLESS PILE OF DEGENERATE ROT!" Jerry throws Nights down, making him roll across the floor in a stunned haze.

"Oh, captain! Would you like to join us? Tuco is teaching me how to play his favorite game, 'Boarden'. I'm not quite sure I get it, but it's a lot of fun!"

Tuco slams his fist on the table, sending a couple colorful tokens that have been placed around flying. "Don't GET IT? Bloody hell, kid, you're the best god damn gambler I've ever seen. I've gone against the greatest Boarden players in the galaxy and you're whooping my ass. I'm not even going easy!"

Jerry blushes. "Oh... sorry. I'm not trying to make you look bad..." Tuco laughs.

"Don't worry about it kid. Just uh... never go gambling in public. There's a lot of people out there who don't like to lose, and you'll probably end up dead sooner or later. But if you ever DO wanna go... just invite me, alright? I wanna see those sons of bitches get their due."</text>

	<text>"I've been an actor since the day I flunked out of university. I started running a side gig at a traveling carnival as a mascot, where I befriended one of the carnies. That was Paul. We never saw eye to eye on a lot of things. Politics, especially. But we did both have higher hopes for ourselves and our futures than just some carnival shitshow. He had dreams of making his own TV show, and when I told him I had always wanted to be an actor - we had a crazy idea. We pooled our money, and we started recording after work in the big tent. I'd wear my costume and we'd do some basic family friendly comedy. It was a strange time. The Federation was still relatively new, and the Union was still recovering from the Fed-Mantis War. Things looked good for a while, after the Federation managed to put an end to the Inquisitions. People wanted light, fluffy entertainment. Something to just laugh at and forget about that dreadful war. We never expected to find such success... But we blew up! We got a small segment at the end of some big front runner cartoons on a major Union network, and soon started up the Ellie the Equinoid show for real! Things were so hopeful back then... god... and now it's all come to this." Stephan burries his face in his hands, signalling his story is over.</text>

<event name="SOCIALIZE_STEPHAN_GENERIC_2" unique="true">
	<text>"I'm a bit ashamed I didn't fight in the Federation-Mantis War. I'm a bit too junior, but not by much. Regardless, I've been a supporter of the Federation since day one. Or I suppose, more accurate, I've been anti-anything that's against the Federation. The Rebellion is a scourge on the Union, the brainchild of people who really, truly think a galaxy where every species is isolated from each another is a good one. That it's the only way to maintain peace, somehow. Wentworth is an idiot, not a mastermind. He's not really the one who turned the Rebellion into a death machine. It was his corporate interest friends, always whispering in his ear during nights of secret society poker games, that led us here. Frankly, the thing that ruined the Union wasn't even remotely the immigrants, it was the xenophobic masses who wanted rid of them so badly they were willing to tear the whole damn nation apart." Stephan shakes his head in disgust.</text>

	<text>"I wonder what happened to Elena... it's been so so long. Do you think she knows? About me, and Ellie? When she left me, it wasn't this bad. It wasn't mania, it was just obsession. To think, if I had just gotten my act together..."
	
Stephan lingers, tears forming in his eyes. "No... I can't... I can't keep dwelling on this. I'm going to tear myself apart if I keep this up. I need to forget Elena. I need to forget the Wentworths, and my old life. I need to be a new Stephan. No longer a circus freak, no longer Ellie. Thank you, captain, for showing me this light."</text>

	<choice hidden="true">
		<text>Yes.</text>

			<text>Stephan nods. "Then we're in the same boat. This dread, this fear of existence... sometimes it makes me miss the numbness of being Ellie. I didn't know fear, or death, or dread. But is that worth becoming a monster? I guess not. Nothing is. I find so often we try to escape ourselves, escape our mortality, that we let ourselves become something we're not. We become the worst we can be, because when we're our worst, when we hate everyone else and see everyone as an enemy, then death seems like the least of our worries. Now, there is nothing left for me to fear but death. I've lost everything, and yet I still cling to my life. God, I'm such a mess..."</text>

	<choice hidden="true">
		<text>But what is death?</text>
		<event>
			<text>"I'm afraid I'm not that philosophical, captain." Stephan laughs. "If you haven't noticed, I used to play a horse in a show for 11 year olds. I'm not exactly a brainiac. If you're asking those kinds of questions though, then keep at it. We need more people who think critically about this existence, and don't rush headfirst into the fray..."</text>

	<text>"When the Ellie show was still new, and just a little circus sideshow Paul and I ran, one of our biggest struggles was naming the character. That was, until I met a lovely young lady. Her name was Elena, and she became the center of my world. When we started dating, I started calling her by a new nickname. Ellie. Pretty little Ellie lingered in my thoughts every day, every moment of my life. It sat there, brewing, just long enough that one day it just... came to me. 'Ellie the Equinoid'! I just... shouted it. Heh. Paul was startled by the outburst, but it didn't take any convincing. It was a perfect name, and it stuck. The executives we were trying to pitch the show to loved it as well, but most important Elena thought it was fantastic. And so, Ellie came to be."
	
Stephan looks at the floor. "And now, the name Ellie carries not just one but two sorrows for me. A reminder not only of my disastrous career and descent into madness, but the love of my life I couldn't keep."</text>

	<text>Jerry cautiously approaches Stephan, taking a seat next to him. "So uh... you're the actor who plays Ellie?" Stephan nods. "Who PLAYED Ellie. That gig is up. I don't... I shouldn't ever go back. Nor could I, with this... mess. And uh, who are you?"
	
Jerry seems almost disappointed the man doesn't know him. "Oh, I'm Jerry." Stephan nods. "Jerry. Right, good name. Well, to what do I owe the pleasure, Jerry?"

Jerry shrugs. "It's just... have we ever met? In the costume you felt familiar, but without the costume you feel even more familiar. I just don't know from where, is all."
	
Stephan sighs. "I'm sorry kid. I've met so many people, so many fans, I just can't remember them all. Maybe when you were younger you attended a tour or something? If your parents used to ta-"

Jerry cuts him off. "Oh, no. I never really knew my parents. My mother died when I was young and I never met my father. My uncle raised me for most of my life."</text>

			Stephan stops cold, his pupils retracting. "You... your uncle is who? I'm sorry I think I... I misheard you." Jerry repeats himself. Stephan wavers. "Your... your uncle is... Wentworth? Like... No... no no no... Oh my god..."
			
			Jerry looks at the terrified man, afraid he might be on the verge of another breakdown. "Stephan, are you okay? What's wrong? Do I need to get you to the medical room?!"
			
			Stephan steadies himself, trying to pretend like everything is fine. "It's nothing... it's nothing. Don't worry about it kid." Stephan forces a smile. "I'm sorry for worrying you, that's all. Wentworth for an uncle or not, you seem to have turned out alright. Probably better than however your father could have raised you, yeah?" Stephan chokes back some tears. "I-I'm sorry about your mother. And your father. And everything... Oh god Jerry I'm so sorry..." Stephan can't hold it back any longer, and breaks down sobbing. Jerry, still utterly confused, holds the man in his arms and consoles him. The tragic irony of the situation will, perhaps, forever be lost on him. But maybe it's for the best he never learns who his father really is.</text>

	<text>Anurak, carrying a large pot of soup, manages to grunt out a question to Devorak, asking if he'd like any soup. Devorak turns to him, stares him dead in the eyes, and says, "I don't want your damn soup!"
	
Anurak drops the pot, and his arms go slack by his sides. "Oh... oh. I... I..." Tears begin to form in his eyes, when Devorak starts maniacally laughing. "HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH! I'm only joking friend! Of course I'd love your soup!" Devorak nudges Anurak and winks, and the two begin to laugh together. After witnessing all of this, you're starting to think being in the Duskbringers has had some very adverse effects on both of their mental health.</text>

			<text>You take a seat at the table, and Anurak starts to explain it before Devorak cuts him off. "No, no need old friend. The captain can figure it out as we play, yes? Let us not waste time with instructions."
			
			Anurak seems fairly annoyed. "But what if the captain doesn't figure it out? How will they enjoy the game then? It would be tragic, a calamity! Oh god this game will be ruined if th-" Devorak shushes Anurak. "Calm down, you worry too much. You musn't panic about everything, you will kill yourself with such worrying."
			
			Anurak's panic only furthers. "No, don't you understand?! You don't worry enough, you just rush headfirst into everything! Why can't you be more of a coward like me! There is safety in caution, and you are nothing but a steadfast fool! GAH!" Anurak flips the table over, spilling the game pieces everywhere. You both look at him while he takes a few heavy breaths. "I know... I know you're not a Duskbringer anymore, Devorak. But you still act like one! You rush into everything and never think anything through!" Anurak storms off, and Devorak turns to you. "I just wanted to play a game. What was that?"</text>

But the Duskbringers employ a lot more than just bombing, it's more about warfare at any cost. Once, my team was racing against a Kleptocracy aquatic unit to capture an Aether supply line from the Dynasty. Being trained in such field, we were sure the day was lost. But then, one of my compatriots fell into a pool with the Slugs in it. They all died of electricution. The Zoltan died too, but of course we had a Clone Bay nearby."
	
Devorak ponders this story for a few moments. "Actually, I guess that would be a form of suicide bombing, technically. But that was just a bad example, okay?"</text>

I've received a shipment of some various items from my old clan, gifts of sorts, that they wish to share with you! I'll just leave these here for you." 
	
Freddy places down a large box full of crayon drawings, a several hundred page long fanfiction titled "How I married the Renegade captain and how we defeated the entire Rebellion and Ministry together part 1", and some unwarranted and explicit photography. You put the box in a safe spot and make a mental note to be more grateful Freddy doesn't act this way.</text>

Yet there are dozens of contradictions. I'm terribly confused. I think I am beginning to understand though. Oh, if the Hive had only known how much the Fed-Mantis War would set us back, would we ever have made such a mistake? Oh why even ask. Of course we would have. It's simply in our nature..."</text>

	<text>In a rare display of egotism, you find Freddy bragging to the rest of the crew about his prized decorated shield. A hush overtakes the room as Freddy spins a tale of his encounter with the dreaded Bishop Kyiiiapitet, the leader of the 3rd Royal Brigade during the Fed-Mantis War.
	
"Kyiiiapitet made it his quest to eradicate the Free Mantis by his very own two claws, and the time soon came when my clan was next on his list. Already he had taken the lives of more than half of my former companions from the war, and I wasn't going to be the next! And I wasn't!"

Freddy thumps the ground with his shield, a prideful look in his eye. "That day was the same day the Free Mantis abroad revered me as their leader. It was also the day the Hive forbade the import of tea from the Union. Spiteful bastards."</text>

<event name="SOCIALIZE_FREDDY_GENERIC_4" unique="true">
	<text>Out of curiosity, you inquire what Freddy's original Mantis name was. "What? Why would you need to know that? My name is Freddy, plain and simple. It has been so long since I last spoke native Yetiiik I can barely even remember how to pronounce it. 'Tiifleeiiik', I think. Eugh."</text>

<event name="SOCIALIZE_FREDDY_GENERIC_5" unique="true">
	<text>You ask Freddy why he acts so different from the other Free Mantis, and if there are more like him. "What, more that do not poison our brains with brain rot? Of course, there are thousands of us! It's just that... well, we're the 'smart ones'. I mean no ill will to my less situationally aware brethren, but they are perhaps not the best representation of our culture. The original Free Mantis were engineers, scientists, architects, the thinkers who knew the sins of the war and fled from the Hive. When the Federation did not accept us, we organized into nomadic clans and founded the Free Mantis. The educated among us remain aboard more organized colony ships and rarely get involved in intergalactic affairs, or work for the Union or the Federation. I hope that is a sufficient answer."</text>

	<text>You spot some of the crew struggling to fix some minor damage in one of the subsystems with a welding torch, but before you can assist, Freddy enters and offers to help. With great proficiency he wields the torch and seals the hole quickly and efficienctly. When he spots you watching him, he merely explains: "While my dream of having opposable thumbs may never come true, I see no need to remain unskilled in that of handy work. It is not our biology that holds us back so much as it is our lack of a proper educational system."</text>

	<text>While idly browsing the recreational room, Kaz bumps into Freddy, and the two glance at each other for an odd moment. Kaz bows and apologizes. Freddy accepts his apology but raises another question. "Might I ask, oh dreaded thief of legends, why it is you are always looking at me so strangely? You seem like a good fellow and I doubt you mean for me to take offense, but it is quite odd."
	
Kaz blinks, taken off-guard. "Oh, err. Well it's just that, well, thinking that Free Mantis are supposed to all be stupid, no? Drugs rotting braincells and all that. You not seeming stupid like rest though. You are not taking pheremones then, I assume?"
	
"Oh, uh. No, I don't. I played a pretty crucial role in the development of the synthetic pheromones concoction used by Suzerains and Bishops during the war, and I was able to recreate a more... 'experimental' recipe that the Free Mantis use. I never intended for it to be used in such masses, but that damage cannot be undone. Alas. But please, try not to call my people stupid. They're doing their best."</text>

	<text>You notice Freddy approaching Kaz on one of the cameras and tune into the audio feed out of curiosity. "Good morning, Mr. Plethkilik. I was wondering, if you don't mind me asking, why it is your translation files are still so broken? I've seen you speak beautiful Yetiiik and from what I understand you received a very comprehensive underground education."
	
Kaz shrugs. "Kaz is Mantis, pure and true. I may not always be greatest servant to Hive, but I cannot shaking inner nature as warrior. Because of this, other races fearing me. I get little practice speaking other language. Kaz also learning speak beautiful words from writing many love letter to beautiful Mantis woman. Kaz not finding much attraction to non-Mantis woman, so he not writing many love letter in other language either."
	
Freddy nods, although it's not the answer he expected. "Uhuh... alright. Well, if you ever bear the interest, I may be able to share with you some things I've learned. Mantis women, and warrior blood or not, I think you should find great benefit in communicating more fluently with other races." Kaz agrees, and the two shake claws and part ways.</text>

"Oh, this? This is my friendship belt! In it I have stitched a piece of memorabilia of all the friends I have met in my travels. Look, this one here is from Admiral Ariadne!"

Tuco pushes him aside. "I don't want your damn liquid, I have a hangover. Go away!" However, Guntput insists. "No. Drink."

Anything less than a total, liberal institution must be abolished to achieve universal liberty. If I am still alive when the Lost Suns have acheived their victory, then I forsee myself to be one to carry this fate out." Ariadne's gaze shifts to you.

	<text>You spot Rig talking to himself, and for a moment consider asking him if he's okay when you hear a rumbling sound from his stomach. You quickly realize he's having a conversation with Tintan and decide not to intrude. It's rare to see the pair getting along, so you'll have to find someone else to talk to.</text>

	<text>You hear a deep rumbling from Rig's stomach and ask if Tintan is doing okay. "Is Tan doing okay? She's stuck in my stomach, of course she isn't okay! Hmph." With a sneer, he comments further, "Just be glad you can't hear her like I can. The stream of insults and cursing is ceaseless. Even when I'm trying to sleep she keeps shouting at me. Some real wonderful 'symbiosis' we have going on, indeed."</text>
</event>
<event name="SOCIALIZE_SYMBIOTE_GENERIC_2" unique="true">
	<text>"Rig and Tintan does sort of roll off the tongue, doesn't it? When everything's gone wrong, at least you have the little things to look to sometimes, you know?" Rig pauses as he gets feedback from Tintan on his little discovery.
	
"Well excuuuuse me for trying to have a bit of happiness in my life. You miserable little wench, I bet you were just as insufferable before this! At least people don't have to hear you whine now!" Another pause.

"BY THE CRYSTAL SPIRIT, YOU DID NOT JUST SAY THAT! YOU BITCH! I HOPE YOUR CHASSIS DISSOLVES IN STOMACH ACID!"</text>
</event>
<event name="SOCIALIZE_SYMBIOTE_GENERIC_3" unique="true">
	<text>Rig seems a bit perturbed. Well, more perturbed than usual. "You know, before this happened I used to go to church quite often. Chrysolity was a staple of my life. It made me a bit of an outsider in Zulfiqar, since most of those executive guys weren't too tied to their faith. Of course, everyone had to SAY they went to church, or else the Elders would have taken us down quick as lighting. But me? I was a faithful believer. But this? This makes me question if there is really any sort of benevolent entity out there. And if there is, why this? Why me?"
	
There's a pause as Tintan seems to be talking. "Oh great, thanks for the input Tan. I really just was dying to know that you thought I was a dumb shithead idiot because I went to church. Like no Zoltan ever has been religious. Not like you have a whole damn government-subsidized nebula full of monks or anything! The Ministry is practical a theocracy as well! Why do you think our species get along so well?" There's total and uncomfortable silence, as Tintan seems unable to retaliate.

"Yeah, shut you up did I?" Another rumble. "Oh go to hell."</text>
</event>
<event name="SOCIALIZE_SYMBIOTE_GENERIC_4" unique="true">
	<text>Despite the two never seeming to get along, you notice Rig still refers to Tintan as just 'Tan', almost affectionately. You could ask them about it, but it might set them off on another argument.</text>
	<choice hidden="true">
		<text>Why do you call her Tan?</text>
		<event>
			<text>"You mean why the nickname? Oh, I dunno. Hard not to get at least a little attached to the woman living inside your stomach, even if she's an unbearable wench sometimes." He smiles. "She reminds me of most Rockmen I know. A stubborn asshole who can say the most offensive, insensitive things and yet still somehow be likable." He listens to the rumbling in his stomach. "Oh don't go soft on me now Tan. It just doesn't feel like you unless you end your sentence by calling me some new variation of a slur."</text>

		<text>What's wrong?!</text>
		<event>
			<text>"I just realized how messed up this all is! Oh my god, holy shit, this is disgusting! This is abhorrent! How the hell did we get here? I have a living person in my stomach and I'm just carrying on as if everything is NORMAL! THIS IS NOT NORMAL!" Rig falls to the ground and begins to sob. His stomach is silent, and if you had to guess Tintan is going through something similar. It is incredibly messed up, but hopefully as soon as the mission is over you can get them the medical attention necessary.</text>

	<text>One day, almost out of nowhere, Rig storms into the lounge where Billy is relaxing and hoists him up off the ground. "YOU DID THIS DIDN'T YOU?! YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR RUINING MY LIFE! I JUST KNOW IT, YOU SLUG PIECE OF SHIT!"
	
Billy, although startled, isn't about to let this go without a fight. "HAH! Oh god I wisssh it wasss! Sssservess you right, Rockman! You know Hektar sssellsss the sssuperior productsss, but becaussse you have all that rich church money to pump up your marketing, you jussst got better exposssure! Of courssse you'd try and pin thisss on me! You think I'm the kind of assshole who'd ssstick two people up each other'sss assshole? Come on, I have more ssstyle than that! I might be cold but I'm not cruel! If my credit with Vael wasss any better I'd just have had you killed, ssssimple and painlesss."

Rig tosses Billy down in a heap, still seething but trying to calm down. "Right, forgot you were too busy trying to pay off your crippling debt to a serial murderer. Pffft, but really? Hektar selling better products? Hah! You wish! Zulfiqar sells reliable, affordable, and standardized equipment for ships of all kinds. Your modular shit is a short lived novelty for crack addicts and pirates! That hideous, eye-wrenching blue and yellow color scheme makes me want to puke! You keep telling yourself it was Zulfiqar that put you out of business if it's what lets you sleep at night - but deep down, you know it's just because your company isn't worth the crate of slime you evolved out of."</text>

	<text>Tony and Rig are sitting across from each other, in the middle of a conversation. "Rig... how did you ever recover from the 'incident?'"
	"Recover? I wouldn't exactly say I 'recovered.'"
	"I mean, you seem fine enough. Functional-"
	"FUNCTIONAL? Tony, I have a ZOLTAN LIVING IN MY STOMACH! I am not okay in the slightest, every waking moment of my existence is pure misery and I don't even know why I haven't ended it yet!"
	"Well uhm... besides that, I mean. How did you cope after we were separated?"
	"I DIDN'T. I didn't cope at all! I could barely hold my job, I was depressed all the time, I had to go to therapy daily. 7 years isn't enough time to get over that kind of thing. A whole damn lifetime isn't enough! And this situation now certainly isn't helping."
	Tony seems to take this in. "So... you're saying that me being like this isn't my fault? That this is normal?"
	Rig shrugs. "Normal? Probably not. Your fault? Hell if I know. But you're not alone in this. If we walked away from that even remotely normal it'd have been a miracle. We're both still alive, we're rich as all hell... it could be worse."
	
	The conversation continues, changing topic to other more trivial things like soap operas. You decide to stop listening and go back about your duties.</text>
</event>
<event name="SOCIALIZE_SYMBIOTE_TONY_2" unique="true">
	<text>Rig approaches Tony suddenly, proposing a new idea. "I want to buy a ship, when this is all over." Tony is very confused. "A ship? Okay...?"
	"Yes, a ship. For the three of us. Hopefully when Tan and I are separated. We can call it something stupid, like 'The Unholy Mistake'. We'll fly it around, and go kill some Slugs probably."
	Tony seems pleased with this idea. "A Slug hunting gig doesn't sound too bad. But... let's not get genocidal here. We just kill the BAD Slugs, okay?"
	Rig nods. "Okay, deal. The bad Slugs. And maybe when it's all over, we can go crash the ship on one of those Leech suicide moons as a standing testament of our burning hatred of this existence."
	"Crash it with US on it?" Tony seems both frightened and excited by the idea."
	"Uhm... well it wasn't what I was thinking, but maybe. Hopefully, by then, we'll hate living at least a little bit less. To be honest, I kind of just want to name a ship 'Unholy Mistake'. We're rich enough to crash a couple dozen of them anyways."</text>

Sorry, I'm trying to get some sleep right now. Ever since I woke from stasis I've had a dreadful case of insomnia, and to remedy it I try to wander the halls. I got the advice from a friend I met on a diplomatic mission, actually! You aliens and your... creative solutions. I do hope to try and get some shut-eye before the mission carries on though, so if at possible I'd appreciate it if you left me alone for a while."</text>

		<text>What's the black and red armor?</text>

			<text>"This? Oh, this was a gift from Kataaagingi, the owner of Tiiikaka. It was part of one of my... less successful, but more interesting diplomatic exursions. I was on a personal quest to convince the pirate lord to end the slave trade in Imperial space. The agreement DID happen, thankfully, but it didn't stop the enslavement of Crystals entirely. Unfortunately, the Theocracy is known to employ Tiiikaka quite often, and it has become common practice for Crystal slaves to serve on Inquisition vessels. Any Crystal not in Imperial space is still vulnerable, but at least Imperial space itself is safe. Mostly... and only from slavers... Mmm..." Ruwen scratches his chin uncomfortably. "The armor is cool though! It's made for a Mantis so I can't exactly wear it, and they pulled it off of a dead guy... but... well it looks cool on a shelf?"</text>

		<text>What's the purple gun?</text>
		<event>
			<text>"Now that, that is a fine piece of weaponry. Foreigners make such fascinating guns sometimes - I wish we Crystals had such craftmanship." Ruwen runs his large golden hand over the gun. "It was a gift from chairman Irwin in the EHG, as part of an agreement I made near the beginning of my career as ambassador! Some Clansmen had begun hunting my kind, as you would expect of course, and it was my task to put an end to it. Irwin was surprisingly diplomatic, though I hear he isn't chairman anymore. Unfortunate. I learned much of Slug culture from him!"</text>

Irwin moans. "Ssssome basssstard betrayed me and threw me in the gutter! But let'sss not linger on it. It'sss been yearsss, and it'sss a ssssore sssubject ssstill." Ruwen nods.

It wasn't part of a diplomatic mission, they just followed me around until I'd accept it. Oh, such strange creatures. I don't mean to sound rude but I am quite glad they seem to be the outliers.

At the end of a terrible civil war, which left the species divided across the galaxy, he swore to seal himself away with all remains of that war forever. This tale has since been mythologized as the tale of Ycathine's Crypt, and most don't even seem to believe it's real." Dianesh waits a few moments, then smiles smugly.

	<text>"The life of a Crystalline Empress is a hard one. I had to undergo vigorous, constant training not only from my mother on all the obscure etiquettes I would need but also my father. You see, a Crystalline Empress is also functionally a warrior queen. I am the head of state and chief military commander, and so I am expected to be a competent warrior myself." Dianesh doesn't seem to find this memory pleasant, but keeps going anyways. "I am the first female head of state in the Empire for nearly 13 centuries. Most didn't expect highly of me. I've always had the extra burden on my back of having to prove to everyone I'm worth remembering in history for more than just the novelty of being female. I am not just an 'Empress'. I want to be a part of history, forever. I want to be remembered for MY accomplishments, and not just the circumstances of my birth."</text>

	<text>"My people have never been too particularly attached to their faith. There has always been religion, but it is a footnote of our history. Never did I feel too strongly about it until I witnessed just what the Theocracy used it for. Having known what it feels like to be revered as a goddess, I now know for certain there can be no god. No higher being with any dignity would allow their image to be disgraced by the sorts of egregious means of worship and oppression comitted in their name. If I had the power to strike the Elders down like they so claim, then I would have done so ten times over. No person should ever be forced to endure such machiavellian psycological shackles."</text>

	<text>Out of curiosity, you ask Dianesh just how the Elders managed to erase all memory of Crystals from the galaxy. "Hmph. I was wondering when you might ask. It is a common misconception among foreigners that the Rockmen and Crystals lived closely together throughout all of the Rock-Crystal Empire. Our two civilizations were spread apart by the length of several systems, and we Crystals have always been isolationists. The Elders didn't have to try hard to chase us away, because we were barely here to begin with. Most galactic civilizations were still fledgling and had barely interacted with us at the time. Most probably assumed we were just a mutation, or they had imagined us, if they even knew we existed at all."</text>

	<text>"So, I take it you are Empress Dianesh then." Ariadne takes a seat across from Dianesh, and the two women stare at each other a bit uncomfortably. "Yes, I am her, and she is me. You are... the Lost Sun Admiral. I apologize if I forgot your name."
"Ariadne." Ariadne announces her name with a piercing effect, making sure Dianesh never forgets it. The air between them is tense, although not necessarily hostile. "So, have you come here to tell me I am another corrupt, evil autocrat who's rule must be expunged from the face of existence like the Elders? If that is your intent then I advice you just cut to the chase and say it."
Ariadne shakes her head. "On the contrary. I came to say I have a lot of respect for you, girl, both personally and in your leadership. I'm a revolutionary but I'm not a radical. I know you were born into this, you didn't seize this power yourself. From what I can tell you seem to be doing a good job. I know you have your people's wellbeing in your heart and mind at all times, and that's ultimately what matters most in a leader."
	
Dianesh nods, although a bit confused. "Uhuh... Well I am pleasantly surprised to hear that then. Your men haven't been the most... polite to mine, with all that feuding between the Suns and the SSLG. But really, I assure you, my intent is not just to extend my power. If you want a Rock democracy, by all means you can have it. We are two distinct species now, and I have no delusions about it. But I do think there are many benefits to a renewed sistership between us. One where we are equals, and not the basis of a religion."
"Good. I'm not a fan of imperialism, but I'm sure we can make something work. But if you double cross me, I will-" Dianesh cuts her off. "You will what, crush my head with your own bare hands? No need to finish that sentence, because I was only going to tell you the same." The two women smile at this mutual understanding and shake hands.</text>

	<text>"Hello dear Empressss! Tisss a good day for monarchy, to have two sssuch prominent and powerful leadersss united on thisss vesssel!" Slocknog nods to Dianesh and pulls his special lighter out from his pocket and lights a cigarette, then offers one to the empress. Dianesh considers the roll for a few moments before turning it down reluctantly.
"I... appreciate the sentiment, yellow Slug." Slocknog stops her. "Sssslocknog." He extends his tentacle, which Dianesh shakes without much force. "Right, Slocknog. As I was saying. I appreciate the sentiment, but... well I'm quite confused. The Kleptocracy does not have monarchs. You talk so much about bloodlines and legacy... but Slugs don't have that anymore. I vaguely remember the ancient days of the Clairvoyant Empire, but that empire vanished by the time my kind reemerged into the galaxy."
	
Slocknog is speechless. "Uhm... well... uh... It'sss a bit of an unconventional approach to monarchy, yessss. But we have to make due sssometimesss with what the left handssss usss sssometimesss, yesss?"
"The... left? I don't understand what you mean."
"Yessss, the left. You know, the liberal essstablissshment. Any good leader knowssss compromissse isss necessssary, but ssssometimesss thessse liberalssss really get on my nervesss. They're trying to change too much at oncccce, too much reform will dessstabilizzze the nation! It'ssss clear if you follow hissstory, the passst wasss alwaysss better."
"I... what are you talking about? It sounds like if people are trying to constantly reform the Kleptocracy, you clearly have issues that need reform. If so people want change for the better, why not give it to them? I don't know much about Kleptocracy politics, but I do know there seems to be a lot of turmoil over there right now."

	<text>Despite the loud, obnoxious, and disheveled mess that Nights seems to currently be, apparently once long ago he was a feared and respected pirate captain. It's hard to believe, but maybe you can get him to tell you a bit about it while he's more sober?</text>
	<choice hidden="true">
		<text>Ask Nights about his history.</text>
		<event>
			<text>"Why the hell do you care?" Nights slams down his empty bottle on the floor and rolls over on his couch so he can glare at you. "Fine. You want to hear a frickin story or whatever? Oncccce upon a god damn time there wasss a perky Ssslug who thought he was invincccible and sssailed the cosssmosss trying to make a name for himsssself, jussst like hisss heroesss. Piratesss were like cccelebritiess back then. Tuco, Kazaaakplethkilik, everybody knowsss 'em and everybody lovesss 'em. But life asss a pirate ain't easssy. You gotta maim, you gotta kill, you gotta be a brute. And Mr. Invincccible realizzzed he ain't a killer. A ssswindler sssure, but he never had the spirit of ruthlessss killing."
			
			Nights picks up his bottle again and tips it upside down, trying to get the last drop out. He gives up eventually and tosses it back down and groans. "Mr. Invincccible getsss a gang together, buysss a fancccy ship with daddy'sss gambling money, and makes a bit of a name for himssself assss a gentleman pirate. One with brainsss and wit who'll rob the daylightssss out of anyone who dessservesss it but wouldn't hurt a fly unlesss he had a reassson. He getsss real popular, and friendsss ssstart telling him he ought to be a politician! Makess sssensssse. Everybody wassss tired of Ssslocknog and his conssservative, traditionalissst idealsss. Nationalissst fervor dessstabilizzzed the nation and sssent a bunch of haplessss kidsss off to die against a bunch of tapewormsss and geode worssshipping clergymen in sssome ssstupid aimlesss war. And with Mr. Invincccible being sssuch a new liberal thinker, and a popular one at that, why ssshouldn't he lead the Kleptocraccccy?"
			
			Nights chuckles, lost in some deep irony only he understands. "Mr. invincccible thought it'd be fun. Thought politicssss would be asss much an adventure as being a pirate. And who could blame him? The god damn 'election' cccycle involvessss a bunch of moronssss raccing to sssteal sssome sssstupid ssshitty crown. It'sss a mockery, but it'sss a sssacred tradition. A compromissse invented after the fall of the Clairvoyant Empire over a cccentury ago. And when he got that crown it felt like the galaxy wassss falling apart. Within a week the former king had been chasssed into exile and Mr. Invincccible was on top of it all. He wasss king! And it wassss terrible. There was no adventure. No dazzling misssionss of death-definy glory. Just a bunch of ssstuffy clownsss in sssuits and gownsss trying to get him to sssign thissss and that. They told him there wasss plenty of fun to be had. The partiesss. Not much a partier he wasss before he wasss king. But the boozzze and the drugsss and the sssex, it wasss the only thing left that could ssstimulate the russsh of the old daysss. And sssso he got lossst in it. Devoured by the temptation to fill the void, he became a ssshadow of what he onccce wasss. A mockery of both a pirate and a politicccian. Cccertainly not a king."
			
			Nights mimmicks a bow, laughing sadistically as he does. "And there you go Renegade! There's your pirate ssstory. I hope it wasss asss exccciting and daring asss you had hoped it to be! Hah! Now leave thissss old wassshed up asssshole to hisss boozzze and ssstop reminding him of what onccce wasss."</text>

	<text>Irwin is asleep in his quarters, though you wouldn't know it from outside. You can hear the occasional fumble and shout, followed by mad ramblings of facts about the biologies of rare alien species, conspiracy theories he personally crafted, and vengeful promises against those who wronged him. You decide it's best not to talk to Irwin right now and remind yourself it'd be a good idea to run psychological evaluations on the crew every so often.</text>

<event name="SOCIALIZE_IRWIN_GENERIC_6" unique="true">
	<text>You spot Irwin reading a strange looking book made of physical paper, a rarity nowadays, and inquire what it's about. To your surprise, he's actually fairly enthusiastic that you've asked. "It'ssss a collection of ssstudiess on the history, anatomy, and ssspecial adaptations of Equinoidsss by region." Irwin shifts in his chair to see you better and asks if you'd like to know more.</text>
	<choice hidden="true">
		<text>Sure.</text>
		<event>
			<text>Irwin flips back a couple pages and orients himself in the text, but seems to realize the text is too technical for you and settles for explaining it himself.
			
"No one'sss quite sssure where Equinoidsss originated from, though it'sss possssible they may have come from the sssame sssyssstemss ass the Cryssstalline Empire. They likely looked a lot different compared to what they're known assss know though. At sssome point, the Guild found a planet with a large concccentration of alpha Equinoidssss, a ssspecial breed which growsss cryssstal-like growthsss on itss body. Ssstudiesss sssuggesst alphasss posssesss far greater intelligenccce than common Equinoidsss, and thusss facccilitated larger herd sssizesss. Thisss planet became the sssourccce of very profitable trade ssselling the Equinoidsss asss beasssts of labor, or for their colorful hidesss. That isss, in fact, why we chossse the particular location that the Guild isss currently headquartered."
			
"The book doesssn't sssay all of that, by the way. It'sss a children'sss book." He flips the cover around to show a colorful cartoon drawing of a six-legged horse eating some grass. "I jussst know all of thisss because I wasss, you know... there when it happened." Irwin sighs and closes the book. "Bassstards sssure regret they kicked me out now! Probably.

"Yes, I am thhhe genius formally known as Professssor Alkali." You notice Alkali slur his s's, mocking Irwin's speech.
	
Irwin's excitement seems to bubble for a moment before he settles down. "Wow, it'sss an honor to meet you! I'm an avid hunter of your creationssss. You've created sssome of the mossst exotic and unique lifeformsss I have ever had the pleasssure of adding to my collectionsss. I jussst wanted to give you thisss, asss a gift for your work."

To make a profit you have to appeal to the worssst in people. Neither of usss wanted to believe it at the time. We tried our bessst, we really did! We tried to change thingssss. Thisss wasss back when Nightsss wassss a breath of fresssh air and people really believed thingsss could change! But thingsss... thingssss don't change.

	<text>Tyrdeo slithers past, humming a song in his native language that doesn't pass well through your translator. Curious about it, you ask him what the song is. "Oh, this little tune? It's just one from my childhood! We used to sing it on the playground as kids! So much nostalgia..."</text>

It's hard to do gardening aboard a spaceship so I wanted to find other venues of artistic expression. I'll uh... I'll take the paintings down. I'm sorry."

	<text>"I think some species are quite strange in the characteristics they look for in a leader!" Tyrdeo shakes his head. "The Republic has been down on its luck - I swear, I was trying! - but I find the leaders of more functional nations to still be quite silly! What do people see in Lumei or Wentworth or..." Tyrdeo hesitates his next words. "Well... Nights, I guess. I don't want to slander my ally but... he's a bit gruff, you know? It sure was nice to have another leader in that room who was gay, but god did he drink like the world was about to end!" You can tell if you don't stop him now, Tyrdeo's about to open the floodgates to ranting.</text>
	<choice hidden="true">
		<text>Let him continue.</text>
		<event>
			<text>"And god did he smell! He smelled terrible, awful, truly miserable. I heard he was once quite attractive and cunning back in the day. I got see that Gregory at least a little bit, but things sure went downhill fast! The excesses of the Kleptocracy, it's ridiculous how much they waste! Spending billions funding government-run pleasure cruises and casinos and bars, and... and they drink and they gamble and by god! How do they manage to stay afloat? The Kleptocracy should be in ruins like the Republic if they've really been running themselves this way all this time! It's a shame Slocknog thought it wise to invade us, because I had heard great things about him before that!"</text>
			<choice hidden="true">
				<text>Continue...</text>

					<text>"And Nights wasn't even the worst of them! When he wasn't absolutely wasted I actually appreciated his wit sometimes, he could be quite funny and charming! But god, Toarde? The Rockman? By the sweet heavens was he ever a snooze! Always talking about the next move, the next plan, the next battle, bla bla bla. Business, business, business. No rapport, and I swear by golly did I try to have some! Nights and Leik and I would go off on outings sometimes, spend time in each other's nations, get to know each other - but Toarde never came! He's just an unbearable asshole, and the atrocities he comits in his homeland?! It's despicable! I thought the Coalition was supposed to be about a new and better future for the galaxy, but if Toarde was in charge, there sure wouldn't be anything better in his galaxy! Leik was nice though. I could always tell she had more underneath her charisma, trying to weasel what she wanted out of everything, but who can blame her? She never trusted Nights and Nights never trusted her, but she was always gushing with me! Maybe it was because the Republic sided with the Hive during the Federation-Mantis war? Not many did, besides the Confederacy."</text>

							<text>"It's funny, now that I think about it. How casual our meetings were whenever Toarde was out on some other business. Nights was such a party-goer, Leik was always so forthcoming and kind, and I'm certainly not against a bit of fun every now and then... you'd almost think we were friends! And... maybe in another life we could have been? I don't have many friends! It was so nice. I was always aware I was only there by circumstance... just a stroke of luck. I know they were pulling my strings, getting me to do what they wanted. But if that's what it takes to save the Republic then I'll do what I must! I'll do anything to save the Republic, to save my people! I was a good President, god damn it! I did everything I could! I may not be the brightest but I'm no Oertiss, Aerkae, or Kaero!" Tyrdeo starts to break down, but collects himself enough to not cry in front of you. "Oh heavens, I'm very sorry captain! I've been talking for quite a while... I'll go now."</text>

I can't imagine they're too costly, maybe only a salary of a couple hundred scrap for a cheap one. We'd need at least 4 or 5, of course, but it would be manageable, right? Right?" You say nothing, instead staring at Tyrdeo to determine if he's joking or not. "Right... well, I'll take this uncomfortable silence as a no then. Sorry for the trouble. Heheh..."</text>

	<text>"I've heard the Confederacy has a little movement going on, trying to rally support to join the Coalition. I did always wonder if that was going to happen, since the Confederates did support the Hive during the war. What a strange and volatile place we live in. Do you ever think of other galaxies, and what they're like? We have all this fancy Multiverse travel and yet no one's ever been to another galaxy. I'm no spaceologist or astronomologist or whatever they're called but I do think about it quite often. What if we're living in the bad galaxy? Hmmm..."</text>

Then when he was finished and gave me the painting I told him it was beautiful, which was certainly no lie, and he just shut down! Dear... I don't believe I said anything wrong to him."

"Bah, the purity and will of the public conscience is a myth. What this galaxy needs is a set of strong leaders who aren't tainted by democratic notions and have the strength and intelligence to lead us! And I don't mean some bourgeoisie monarchist flakes like Leiiikonpliiinakra or the Elders. I mean someone capable and competent! Those Shells seem to have the right idea.

	<text>"There are days when I regret the side I took in the Federation-Mantis War. There are days I regret my history as a war-hero. There are many days I mourn the lives of all I took. There are countless days I think of the soldiers that I couldn't save. But there is never a day I regret being a part of the Eargen Republic. We are a divided and downtrodden people, but beneath our endless depression there is a great culture and spirit that is all but lost. We must fight to reclaim it. My ideal Republic is no Federation member, this is true. But it is not of the Coalition either. I think our people simply need some isolation, to ponder our national identity and the values we used to stand for so long ago. And when we have, only then shall we emerge from this darkness as a new, vigorous nation full of life and wellbeing for the galaxy.

But are you then, I wonder, really a soldier at all? Or are you just another soul wandering this cosmos with no true purpose? Fighting for anything that seems right in the moment, but never finding a true ground to believe in. Not to say I know the answer, because I don't. And I doubt you do either.

	<text>"There was a dark time in my life when I fell into much the same pit as my Leech brethren. This was shortly after we lost the war, when it felt like the Republic had done the impossible and fallen from grace when it hadn't even had any to begin with. I felt so much shame for who I was and my actions, and so I turned to dark avenues. It never reached, perhaps, the same lengths as many of my kind. But alcohol has a certain allure that seems to draw in and unite all the lost and poor souls in this galaxy. And so I became a drinker. I quit the military and subsided into history, to be forgotten as just another foolish man who thought he had a place in this galaxy. That was, until the Kleptocracy invaded. I could stand the Chrysolic practioners and their invasive monasteries. It was slanderous to our culture, sure, but we Leeches were never a spiritual folk before anyways. But such a brazen attack from an alien foe? I was drawn back into the fray."
	
Alkram blinks, realizing he's been rambling a bit longer than he had anticipated. "What I mean to say, if you are to take the advice of this old general, is what we think we want and what reality shows us we need to be often lacks symmetry. Every man and woman has a purpose, but that purpose ought to be realized only when we're willing to see it."</text>

	<text>"I could have been a poet. Or an author. I studied litterature a bit, and it fascinated me. The way people commanded words was facsimile to troops on a battlefield. In the command of a strategic and skilled author, language can be deployed with as much deadly precision and destructive - or constructive - power as the greatest militaries in the Multiverse. But it was not to be my calling. War had other ideas. And so I put down my pen and traded it for sword, and the rest is history."</text>

	<text>"During the Mantis War I had gained little respect and lost plenty for the Confederacy. At that time the Vampweeds seemed disorganized and weak willed. I foresaw their hasty and shameful surrender long before it happened, signing some document of false peace with the Gathering to bail on the war and leave us all to burn. But I can see under the reforms of this new Premier, Arke'y, they have become as proud and strong a nation as the Eargen Republic once was in its glory days. Perhaps their ideals are not for me, but that is irrelevant as long as they stay true to them. If this was the Confederacy I had fought alongside in the war, I think just maybe victory would have been our glory to reap."</text>

	<text>Alkram approaches Ariadne, flaring his muscles with electric currents in an effort to appear even tougher and more grissled than usual. "So you are the Rockwoman I have heard so much about! How proud I am to serve aboard this vessel with another with such great revolutionary spirit!"
	
Ariadne slowly turns away from her work to look at the Leech. "You and I are about as similar as fire is to coffee. I turned away from the life of a princess in the house of one of the most powerful men in the entire known Multiverse to fight in mud and trenches to free people who don't even know they're enslaved from a brutal dictatorship led by 5 of the most cunning and murderous monsters in all of history. YOU are an aging veteran who fought on the side of a tyranical Hive mind in some long-gone war and got bored of eating batteries in a retirement home, so you incited the latest of some dozen revolutions in a fractured Republic against a ditzy and eccentric gardener who's greatest crimes were being culturally insensitive to a flower and using political gain as a cover to making friends."

With each word Ariadne makes a violent jab towards Alkram, who reels back in shock from the sudden hostility. There's a few moments of awkward silence before Alkram hurries away in shame.</text>

Jerry nods. "Language can be quite strange. I didn't know about that though!" You can tell Jerry isn't really that interested, but he's just playing along because he has more to say. "So uh... Tony. I know you're going through some stuff so... just in case you're ever feeling down, just know there's always people there for you, okay? Even in the strangest, most unlikeliest of places there's always people looking out for you. Never underestimate your allies."
Tony is touched but not entirely sold. Jerry continues, "If you uh... ever forget that... just remember... uhm... even when things look bad Tony, you're never 'alony'." Jerry smiles sheepishly, and Tony bids him a heatfelt thank you. "To be honest, I think I underestimated you. Not too fond of your uncle, but you seem like a good kid. But, just so you know, alony is a derogatory for a prostitute in my language. So probably not a good idea to go saying that to other Leeches."</text>

Something about their dreadful origins and painful assent made me wish ever more for their highest ascencion. But... their history is mired in a great many tragedies. First, the great infighting of generations. Then, the mandate for the abandon of physical form. And now, the rise of a violent and radical rule which threatens to soon outgrow their original, more peacable rule. They remind me of another kind so long ago who once threatened the decimation of this reality and the next over their own self-destructive foolishness.

The Slug was swift, he was skilled, and he disarmed me quickly. I relive that match in my memories, or perhaps more correctly my nightmares, nightly. I could have won... and yet I, Dessius Yan Tartodicus, 16th Prime Reaper and greatest swordsman in the Multiverse, was bested by nothing but a common thief? It is a blot on history..."</text>

Devorak says nothing, completely immersed in the duel. Dessius continues to taunt him, but you watch as Devorak seems to slip into a zen-like state. In just three strokes, he parries Dessius's swing, cuts upward, and disarms Dessius. With a metalic rattle the Reaper's sword flies to the opposite end of the room. Dessius is shocked. "So, thou hath bested me. So be it. I have been rendered disarmed. Claim your victory then, Zoltan." Dessius bows.
However, Devorak does not accept his victory. "I do not fight to win, Ghost. I fight for the exhilaration, and the reminder that I am still alive. Even in a friendly duel I am briefly reminded of my mortality. I do not wish to claim this victory. I am satisfied in having fought well against a talented opponent."

Dessius is not discouraged. "Through thine grapevine I hath become aware you seek the siren song of the end.

Nights, despite his stupor, is confused. "What're you talking about lizzzzard?"
Guntput frowns. "You have initiated the beginnings of mating ritual in handing me in the bottle of intoxicating liquor. This means you are expressing a desire to perform the sacred exchange of fluids with me."
	
Nights considers his options for a few moments, then shrugs somewhat enthusiastically. "Well if you're down, I'm down lizzzzard."
Guntput recoils in disgust. "WHAT? No! Guntput would not perform the ritual with you for all the riches in the galaxy! You are gross and smell bad, and very rude! Go away!" Guntput scurries off.</text>

	<text>As you pass, Metyunt stands up and salutes you, wobbling on his two feet. "Captain, I've taken inventory of the cargobay! I reorganized the ammunition by caliber, and I've added the Federation-mandated hazard stickers to any boxes that were flammable, combustible, or otherwise looked dangerous!" He pauses, waiting for your assesment of his work.</text>

Metyunt seems speechless. "Well... I'll go undo my work then. They tell me I was born with photographic memory. Helps with managing I guess, and resetting things when I screw them up..."</text>

	<choice hidden="true">
		<text>Why did you do that?</text>

			<text>"Well, it seemed as though there was no organization pattern for the ammunition, and I figured it would be helpful rather than laying in piles!

Uhm... next time I'll try not to make any changes without your request first."</text>

	<text>You catch Metyunt practically catatonic in his quarters, staring blankly at the ceiling with a big grin on his face and his usual business attire missing. When he notices you, he fumbles around and manages to haphazardly toss some object under his cushions using his tail.</text>

Being around Slugs for so long certainly wouldn't have been the best influence.</text>

	<text>Despite exchanging not yet even a greeting with Metyunt as you pass, he seems to almost immediately launch into some tirade. "Cultural preservation is a pestilent and invasive virus which has damned my species. By clinging to our tribal culture, we all but ensured a life of eternal irrelevance in the galaxy. I don't mean to suggest Hektar of all things was the solution... after review I can say with certainty it wasn't. I've done some reassesment of the situation and I think perhaps blending in with the Zoltan people might suit us. I don't see why our two peoples should be irreconcilable. Given time I'm sure we could flourish!"</text>

<event name="SOCIALIZE_METYUNT_GENERIC_4" unique="true">
	<text>"I'm tired of monarchy. I put all my faith in Queen Thek, and it got me nowhere." Metyunt sighs. "I guess corporate CEOs aren't much better either. For all it's worth, Billy isn't too bad but he's... well he's Billy. Maybe I'll be an anarchist now. Anarcho-capitalist? I've heard that's a thing. Not quite sure how that works but maybe it's worth a try. What could go wrong at this point anyways?"</text>
</event>
<event name="SOCIALIZE_METYUNT_GENERIC_5" unique="true">
	<text>"In the tribe, I was often told my behavior was strange and may have been an indicator of a curse. Every day, I was forced to sing the 'Better Health' song, and dance some humiliating dance before a council of shaman. Every. Damn. Day. Once, I refused to sing for the council. That only made them more sure I was cursed. What kind of lizard doesn't sing and dance?" Metyunt says that last sentence mockingly, bitterness in his voice.</text>
	<choice hidden="true">
		<text>Why'd the queen pick you as a mediator with Hektar then?</text>
		<event>
			<text>"The council grew older and so did I. Internal conflict between the council distracted them and I moved away from my parents. I got a bit into politics, where I was reminded again and again that I acted nothing like my contemporaries. I didn't find much success, but one of the Queen's agents found a file of mine from those old days of the 'curse'. Queen Thek didn't believe in the curse, but she thought my strange behavior and lack of adherence to traditional cultural values made me a good choice. Someone who would fit in with the Slugs." Metyunt snorts. "That's why I was chosen. I was such an antisocial hermit, so eager yet so dissonant and cold, that I was the perfect choice to serve ambassador to a capitalist hellscape. When I did get to Hektar though, they ran some psyche tests on me. Turns out I have some disorder they call 'high-functioning autism'. It wasn't a curse afterall. Not that I ever thought it was, but... well, I guess part of me was relieved to find out in the end."</text>

		<text>You have a curse? Ew, GET AWAY FROM ME!</text>

	<text>Billy strolls up to Metyunt, handing him a massive stack of papers. "Metyunt, I need thessse tax forms filled and promptly thereafter burned by the end of the ccccycle. Oh, and I have a call coming in from a contact with the KoN. Oh, and don't forget my coffee. I'll need it in an hour or elsssse I'm going to sssstart feeling the burn. And when you bring it to me I'm going to have a few more forms for you to file afterwardssss, okay?"
Metyunt nods instinctively, although his posture has deflated. "Y-yes sure! Right away!" Billy nods and whistles, and turns to leave. However, before he makes it out of the room, Metyunt cries out. "Uhm, issss sssomething wrong, Metyunt? You ssssounded jussst now like sssomeone bit your tail off!"
	
Metyunt's eye is stretched even wider than before, and it looks like he's about to pop. "HOLY SHIT! HOLY SHIT!" Billy looks quite frightened, as does everyone else watching the scene unfold. "NO! I'M NOT DOING ANY OF THAT! I DON'T WORK FOR YOU ANYMORE! HAHAHAHAHAHAH! HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH!" Metyunt tears off his suit and tie and lets out a tribal screech. "FREEDOM! FREEDOM AT LAST!"
Billy sighs. "Yessss, yesss, but when you're done having that epiphany I need thossse formsss burned pronto. And you really ssshouldn't have torn that ssssuit, it wasss quite expensssive."</text>

	<text>Just as you finish running some basic details by Billy and start to walk away, you notice Metyunt hurrying to catch up with Billy and ask him something. "Wait, Billy, before you go!"
Billy swivels to face his former employee. "Oh right, the lizard. Yes Metyunt, what issss it? Remember, time isss money!" Metyunt nods, having heard that advice a million times before. "Well it's just... I wanted to know... uhm..."
Billy yawns. "Come on Metyunt, sssspit it out already. Jussst because I'm out of the officcce doessssn't mean the work ssstopsss. Hektar isss ssstill afloat, even if barely, and I have thingsss to do!"
	
"Right right... okay... uhm... What should my last name be?" Billy blinks. "Your... You don't know your lasssst name?" Metyunt shakes his head. "No no, I don't HAVE a last name. My people don't do those. But I heard it's a thing a lot of people do. And I want one."
"But why? Mossst people don't even ussse them when talking to people. Look, take it from sssomeone who livesss in a nation with a fractured culture divided between two warring factionsss of ultraconsssservatisssm and ultraliberalisssm. Adjusssting your way of life to match another'sss can be helpful, but if your only reassson for doing ssso isss 'other people are doing it, ssso I ssshould too' then it'sss not sssuch a good idea. Just be yourssself. The name people call you doessssn't matter nearly asss much asss who you are ass a perssson."
	
Metyunt seems satisfied with that. "Hmm... maybe you're right. You sound like you've given this a lot of thought." 
Billy shrugs. "I guesssss. I'm not a philosssopher, and now my brain hurtsss. If you don't mind, I'm going back to being extremely profitable now."</text>

	<text>Since the two lizards first joined your crew, every time Guntput and Metyunt walk past each other Guntput makes a strained effort to wack Metyunt on the head with his staff, shouting various insults like "Traitor! You are not worthy of the scales you wear!" and "You bring great shame to the tribe for your actions!" This time, however, Metyunt seems to finally have had enough. As Guntput goes to swing his staff, Metyunt grabs it and snaps it in half. "ARE YOU DONE?! I GET IT, I SCREWED UP! I'M A TRAITOR, A BLOODY TRAITOR AND I RUIN EVERYTHING I TOUCH! I'M A FAILURE, I'M A MESS, AND THERE IS NO HOPE FOR ME! HAPPY NOW? CAN I GO ON AND LIVE MY LIFE WITHOUT YOU HAVING TO REMIND ME OF MY MISTAKES EVERY MOMENT OF MY EXISTENCE?!"
	
Guntput seems utterly at a loss for words. In all his years of being a shaman, it seems never once have any of his people ever spoken to him like this. "Guntput... Guntput is-" Metyunt cuts him off, still screaming. "GUNTPUT IS WHAT?! WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? DO YOU WANT ME TO THROW MYSELF OUT THE AIRLOCK? DO YOU WANT ME TO FLY TO OUR HOMEWORLDS AND PUBLICLY EXECUTE MYSELF FOR MY SINS? My entire life, you shamans have been making me miserable. I'm sick and tired of your phony, uppity attitude! You don't know anything! You think wisdom is your birthright, and yet you think you can solve all our problems by avoiding technology! You know NOTHING! You're the true blight that's doomed our species!"
Metyunt storms off, leaving Guntput behind still trying to find words. Unable to think of anything, Guntput quickly shuffles away in the opposite direction, too ashamed to even look at you or anyone else.</text>

Cannot access restricted data without authorization code. If you believe this is an error, please contact engineering head E.W." A55's eyes return to their usual orange. "Apologies, but I simply couldn't get past the blockage. Arg, how unfortunate. Lemme tell you captain, if I could get all me old memories back, I would! For the future then it seems it'll have to wait!"</text>

			<text>A55 apologizes. "For what it's worth captain, what I can remember about the name was all the engineers who made me mocking me. I don't mind though. Ho ho, the one good thing about being a robot is you can't help but have thick skin, aye!"</text>

	<text>You debate the ethical controversy over whether or not A55 deserves his own quarters aboard the ship. Frankly, he still seems fine living in the broom closet. It's certainly better than the previous location next to the toilet at least.</text>

Aenwithe seems confused. "Your... wish? I fail to understand what it is you're referring to. I'm not a genie in a bottle."
"Arg, could you design a cognitive? One to install in my lovely Doctor Drone? Oh she's so sweet but sometimes I long for a companion that will love me back!"
"A55, I can make the Doctor Drone sentient, but I can't make it love you."
A55 doesn't seem fazed by this. "Arg there'll be no need! No one can resist my charm!"
Aenwithe lets out a mechanical sigh but finally agrees. "When the mission is over, I'll make you a cognitive companion. But if things won't work out between you, don't come crying to me."</text>

	<text>In the breakroom, A55 rolls up to Jerry with a cacaphony of metallic thuds while Jerry is trying to figure out a rather complicated crossword. "Arg, shy but kind blonde kid! Yer uncle was er... Admiral Vance Wentworth, right?" Jerry nods. "Yeah, he was, uh... pirate... robot?"
	
"Arrrr. So, if you's was kin'n blood of the admiral, and I was say... the brain child of one close colleague of his. That's makes us cousins, don't it? Yeah? Ain't that right matey?" A55 sticks out his non-buzzsaw hand to Jerry. "Well, mister... do you prefer I spell out 'a-5-5' or do you want me to call you 'asshole'?" A55 shrugs. "You can call me either, cousin. Family's more than just names!"
	
Jerry nods. "Well, Captain A55. What you just said doesn't... make much sense at all." A55 frowns. "Oh... I see laddy. I'm sorry. I just... well I have no family. I had a pirate crew! But they're in the past now." Jerry stops the drone. "BUT - if it'll make you happy, we can still be cousins. Or brothers. Or whatever. Family is more than just blood too." Jerry shakes A55's hand and the two go to work on the crossword together.</text>
