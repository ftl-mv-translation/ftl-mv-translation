My proposition is simple: assist me in collecting artifacts relating to Mr. Wentworth, and you will be rewarded, perhaps financially or maybe even further.

	<text>"Have you taken note of the appearance of this toy? Clearly a child found much use in it. From what I understand after Mr. Wentworth went off to the great war, his parents were killed, and when he returned, he sold off many of his childhood possessions. This toy is custom made: a gift, from the stark and conceited CEO of Wentworth Innovations to her son. The family and company icon happen to be the Kestrel. It clearly left an impression on young Mr. Wentworth, as such representation inevitably found its way into the Rebellion's own emblem. What, you thought that was some other avian, Renegade? Perhaps you find it ironic, that the symbol of humanity shares its name with the namestake of Federation ship-building? It's not a coincidence. In the early days of the Federation, Wentworth Innovations was behind the construction of those ships."</text>

	The tapes show, strangely, very little political deliberation behind closed doors. Instead, Vance and Devorak, after a few moments of stiff awkwardness, eventually break tensions and begin to light-heartedly debate their ideologies, finding much common ground between them.
	In the end, both men get up, shake hands, and sign the treaty with renewed vigor, before marching off out of view. It's strangely uncanny, seeing the leader of the human-centric Rebellion getting along with not only an alien, but one of such infamously radical ideals to rival Vance himself.

	C.U.R.A. too seems at a loss for words. "What nonsense is this? These must be incomplete. Renegade... I was very clear with my instructions, and yet you have failed to bring back the full archive. Hmph. I will permit forgiveness for this mistake, but only this once. Do not fail me again."</text>

	Description: An Arcadian Outpost nearby appears to have stored away a physical copy of the contract that began the C.I.C.A. project. It is unlikely the Arcadian engineers will be co-operative, so for once I recommend opening this confrontation with your usually barbaric Renegade tricks. You need not worry about destruction - in the case of critical hull failure, recovery pods containing vital data are jettisoned to be collected by service drones later. Please do not waste time with negotiations.
	Requirements: Retrieve the document.
