	<text>The hull of the Free Mantis ship rends and buckles as it is torn apart. As you scrap their ship, you reflect that this relatively young faction is not ready for what it takes to be at war.</text>
	<text>As awful as it feels, sometimes there's no good option. Destroying a ship full of supposed allies isn't something you're proud of - but your mission comes first, and there was no other choice. You prepare to scrap the ship.</text>
	<text>Considering how most Free Mantis want to join the Federation, something feels off about destroying one of their vessels. Hopefully the Warlords will understand what you had to do.</text>
	<text>You wonder, if the Free Mantis here knew the importance of the mission, would there even have been a fight? Their scrap is still useful, all the same.</text>
	<text>Some day, the Free Mantis may join the Federation. Hopefully they will not hold this incident against you when they do.</text>

	<text>Whether it had to be this way or not, circumstances led you to eliminating the Free Mantis crew. You might as well scrap their ship and make sure your mission is a success in the meantime.</text>
	<text>It's easy to feel guilty when all you're left with is corpses, but you know you didn't have any choice. You regret the loss of life, but not what you've done. The scrap from stripping the ship doesn't hurt either.</text>
	<text>The Free Mantis put up a bloody fight, even against their desired allies. However, it was a fight you were more than capable of winning.</text>
	<text>Although the aftermath of a Free Mantis fight is much like a Hive Mantis fight, it feels different to scrap a ship that could have, under different circumstances, been friendly.</text>
	<text>The stench of synthetic pheromones linger as you scrap the derelict Free Mantis ship. Hopefully you won't have to fight many more of these.</text>
