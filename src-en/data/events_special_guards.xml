	<text>Despite their strange and reclusive tendencies, the Orchid Florals are some of the strongest and most reliable allies of the Federation, especially since the Civil War. The Gathering will certainly be the least of your worries here.</text>
	<text>The Gathering stood strong with the Federation during the Civil War, and even in the age of Multiverse travel they remain proud members. The Florals should be more than welcoming to you.</text>
	<text>Long ago the Gathering split, as the industrialist Vampweeds moved into self-exile and founded the Confederacy. Though this turmoil was long before even the day of the Federation, you may still find some Florals bitter about it. That said, they should be quite friendly towards you, as loyal members of the Federation.</text>

	<text>Fortunately for you, the Outcasts have little beef with the Federation or most factions for that matter. The Theocracy prefers to stay clear of this place, instead sending contracted slavers like the Tiiikaka clan as well as occasional Coalition scouts to do its dirty work.</text>

	<text>Apparently, sectors like these are where the legendary Dread-Pirate Tuco once lived. Now, you can find all kinds of people here. Even the Crystal Empire has begun sending "liberators" to the Theocracy, who have found an unexpected sanctuary among the Outcasts. Perhaps you could find the same luck here?</text>

	<text>The Dynasty is one of the oldest running known civilizations on record, possibly longer than even the Lanius or Crystals. Somewhere in the timeline a massive chunk of their territory was simply... erased, and no one but the Ghosts know why. And they certainly aren't telling.</text>
	<text>The Ghosts are biological mysteries, and so is much of the Dynasty's history. Maybe if they weren't so busy blaming the Federation for the Rebellion, they'd actually calm down and explain. But what are the chances of that?</text>
	<text>According to the database, it looks like the Rebels have dispatched numerous Auto-ships to these sectors as part of some weird war against the Dynasty. Hopefully you can stay out of the crossfires as much as necessary.</text>
	<text>The Dynasty isn't particularly friendly to the Federation. They seem to have bunched them in along with the Rebels as 'bad men'. Maybe you can break this stereotype? Probably not, but one can dream...</text>
