	<text>You receive a hail from the nearby Federation refueling station. "Hello!-" The other end is cut off briefly by a loud bang. "SHIT! OW! OH MY GOD! AGH!" The Federation captain returns on screen a moment later. "Ugh... ignore that. We recruited a couple rookies and one of them just dropped a box of fuel on my foot. Sorry about that. Despite my throbbing foot, it's good to see a friendly face! If you need anything, don't hesitate to ask!"</text>
	<text>The Federation anthem blasts through your stereo, temporarily deafening you. An automatic message loops as you rush to turn down the volume. "FEDERATION!!! YEAH!!! FED! ER! A! TION!!!" Despite the overwhelming patriotism from the nearby station, all other business seems to be going as normal. You should be able to get free supplies here.</text>
	<text>A Federation commander aboard the nearby station hails you. "Renegades! Some day I hope to visit Universe 0 myself, but in the meantime it's wonderful to have visitors from the core of the Federation itself. Whatever you need is yours. Go get those Rebel bastards!"</text>

I AM EXCITING! I GIVE YOU ANYTHING! I GIVE YOU FIRSTBORN, I GIVE YOU-" The Mantis promptly collapses, twitching slightly from the raw energy pumping through their veins. Nevertheless, a more able team awaits you in the docking bay.</text>
	<text>You receive a hail from the nearby outpost, where a sobbing Free Mantis awaits you. "You are... so beautiful. So majestic, I deserving not of seeing you! Go, taking the free things and leave before I cry last of every tear!"</text>
	<text>A hail comes in from a human Federation officer working aboard the nearby Free Mantis station. "I must say, these Free Mantis are... very interesting to work with. When I first was rescued from Rebel captivity by one, they kissed me and started praying at my feet. We're married now!" The Federation captain pauses before remembering what he was talking about. "Er... sorry, when you live among the Free Mantis too long you start to ramble about nothing. Is there any assistance you're in need of? I'm sure the rest of the crew here would be honored to help you."</text>

	<text>An outcast aboard the nearby Federation refueling station hails you. "I emigrated to the Gathering in what feels like forever ago. But being a part of the Federation is one of the greatest honors I could ever have dreamed to serve. Allow me to provide anything I can to assist you, Captain."</text>
	<text>It's a bit surprising, although not entirely shocking, to find a Federation outpost here in Outcast territory. A crew of all sorts of species works aboard, and the commanding officer offers you free services in return for your commitment to saving reality.</text>
