	<text>An advertisement appears on your screen as you approach, depicting a slim and well-kept Leech. "Hey there, I'm Mr. Senior. Tony Senior, that is! Owner of Tony's! I'd like to announce our brand new partnership with Hektar Industries! Come on and stop by!" You swear you've seen this ad before long ago. This definitely isn't "brand new", and "Tony's" is a massive retail chain. For some reason they're looping this same ancient ad, but that hardly matters.</text>
	<text>Looks like the nearby station is a "Tony's", one of the only Leech-owned as well as the largest retail chain in the Multiverse. Besides the usual commodities, these stores are infamous for selling military goods suspiciously labeled as "gardening appliances".</text>
	<text>Seems an advertisement from the local Tony's is playing over your intercom. Strange to find such a large retail chain offering military weapons, but considering they also sell second-hand organs and prostitutes, it's not that out of place.</text>
	<text>"Hey there folks! Come on in and stop by your local Tony's! We've got uh... um... come on and stop by!" Despite the unconvincing pitch, you've heard of these places. Owned by a mysterious and elusive Leech tycoon, "Tony's" serves as the Multiverse's largest retail chain, and for good reason.</text>
	<text>A Slug ship flies past but stops when they see you. Their captain half-heartedly hands you a flier advertising "great deals!" on Hektar-brand modular weaponry(tm) being sold at the nearby Tony's. The ship jumps away, but you figure the reputation of the Leech retail chain outcompetes the rudeness of the Slugs.</text>
	<text>A passive-aggressive jingle plays on the stereo, broadcasting from the nearby retail store. "Come on to Tony's! Come on to Tony's! YOU. WILL. SHOP."</text>
	<text>The bright colors and simple yet recognizeable logo of the nearby store brings back memories. The infamous brand of "Tony's" is known for a lot of things, some good, some bad, and some bizarre. A lot of strange myths are centered around its founder Tony Sr., from his involvement in the mafia to a dark past with Zulfiqar. You have no idea if any of these are true, but their stores are known for quality merchandise, and you figure it's worth a look.</text>

	<text>Despite the colorful isles and fascinating trinkets, there isn't much here to excite a mercenary captain like yourself. Though, if you ever need a battery powered tongue trimmer or a complete set of action figures from the hit Leech soap opera "Orfaces of Rilla", you suppose you know where to look.</text>
	<text>There isn't much in the store that interests you, disappointing considering all the tales you've heard of these places. A rather flirtatious Vampweed cashier attempts to get your number, but the bloodstains on her uniform warn you not to give her your time.</text>
	<text>Several alien species roam the stores alongside you, but no one makes any attempts to speak to one another. Not that you could if you wanted to, because the music playing over the intercom is so loud the items on the shelves are vibrating. It's better if you don't stick around in case you lose your hearing.</text>
	<text>A few ancient posters from a long-past Eargen election are still hung up outside. Considering no president has been democratically elected in the Republic for years, it's quite ironic, but a quick chat with the surprisingly friendly staff reveal that it's just become a joke among them. Besides that interaction, there isn't much reason to stick around.</text>
	<text>You stop by the station but don't find anything of interest on sale besides the military supplies. You take a quick detour to the store's bathroom, but the uncomfortable sloshing noises from inside convince you to stay away and just wait until you're back on the ship.</text>

I met with representatives from Zulfiquar to discuss how we'd go about securing test subjects, then a Slug ship arrived and... demonstrated my ideas on them.

But I have their location now... any chance you'd want to get your revenge on them, rather than me?"

Command's received word that Federation insiders have boarded this station! The Federation has come to defile our lands, and undo the dream that the Zoltan race has worked so hard to fulfill!" The crowd murmurs amongst itself, and suspicious eyes dart across the crowd.

	<text>Despite the usual clusters of ruins or Lanius you expect to find here, this beacon holds nothing more than a break from combat.</text>
	<text>A few wrecks float nearby, but they've been picked completely dry. These ancient beings must have been prolific builders to have left so much behind...</text>

	<text>The charts indicate this was the location of a small skirmish over a military facility on a nearby moon. Oddly, scans pick up no signs of debris from either the battle or the station. Yet another area sucked dry by scavengers.</text>
	<text>Scans show no signs of any ships or settlements nearby. You have no way of knowing if the area was always uninhabited or if it was simply erased by scavengers.</text>
	
	<!--<text>You question a local settlement and they describe a fleet of metal ships wordlessly collecting all of the abandoned metal and debris in the area. When they approached important satellites, the settlements fired a few ASB warning shots. The Lanius moved on despite clearly having the firepower to overwhelm the settlements.</text>-->
	<!--<text>A few refugee ships are preparing for the long journey to another sector. They explain how a number of Lanius military ships surrounded them and began to hack their FTL drives. Fortunately the Lanius moved on after briefly scanning the civilian ships, leaving them more than a little shaken up.</text>-->
	<!--<text>You pass a civilian ship that warns of the nearby Lanius. "One of them attacked a civilian transport and started to melt their fracking hull. But then the weirdest thing happened... another metal ship actually fired on its companion until it backed off." Apparently there are disagreements among the Lanius about what should be salvaged.</text>-->
	<!--<text>You come across a human civilian ship preparing to leave the sector. They message you, "We're getting out of here! There was some cult rambling about the spreading of the disease, Humanitis. They forcefully boarded our ship and tried to open all of our airlocks, shouting, "Be purged!" Is nowhere safe anymore?"</text>-->
	
	<text>This beacon is void of Lanius, Ghosts, pirates, or any other ship for that matter.</text>
	<text>The charred remains of a civilian settlement suggests either recent pirate activity or a long ago battle with presumably Rebel forces. Either way, the beacon is now empty.</text>

	<text>This beacon has not yet been touched by the swarms of invasive cultists. It should serve as a well earned break.</text>

	<text planet="PLANET_ANCIENT_TRIO">Three artificial planets, heavily damaged, float in the distance. They are void of a star to orbit, and some day they will crash into each other, but for now this beacon is safe.</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_ANCIENT">You must admit, you've grown used to the pollution caused by frequent ship battles outside of this sector. The clean space around you puts you at ease, and you figure it's okay to do something aboard the ship.</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_ANCIENT_GARUNTEE">An Obelisk settlement has been established on the nearby artificial planet. It looks very well protected, and you decide it's best to be left alone.</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_ANCIENT">Not an Obelisk ship to be seen. You're surprised how busy this sector has been considering the Obelisks are supposedly close to extinction, but you're happy to take a break.</text>
