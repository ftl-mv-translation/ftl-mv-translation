	<text>As soon as you arrive, all of the ships docked at a nearby station scatter and jump while the station itself uses some form of cloak technology to disappear. They mustn't like outsiders here...</text>	
	<text>No ships are in range, so you take the time to scan the area. It seems like every planet you've seen so far shows signs of highly developed habitation without overpopulation. They must have a very structured and well regulated society.</text>
	<text>There appears to be no one living near this node, a rare sight in this highly developed sector.</text>
	<text>You arrive near a civilian settlement. It looks like their homes, ships and stations all rely heavily on an intriguing crystalline material. You wonder how they are able to create so much of this substance, and what benefits it will provide to the other races of the galaxy.</text>
	<text>A few merchant ships pass nearby but they are either ignoring your hails or their computer hasn't yet been adjusted to work through the same frequencies...</text>

	<text>Despite the unfriendly attitude from many of the inhabitants of the sector, it appears you've happened across a trader who doesn't care about who his client is - as long as they have scrap to spend.</text>
	<text>It appears not all Crystals are unwilling to deal with outsiders. A merchant vessel nearby opens communications and requests to trade.</text>
	<text>You receive a hail from a Crystalline vessel. "Outsiders? Look at your tiny ship... Haha!" You roll your eyes and prepare to leave when they hail you again. "Wait, wait, don't leave. This was merely me trying to set up a trade!"</text>

	<text>With the local Rock settlements so unwilling to trade with other life forms, an opportunistic Mantis crew has postponed its piracy activities and set up shop to catch any passing trade.</text>
	<text>The Rock tolerate few aliens in their space, but even they seem to respect the wisdom of the Zoltan - a few of them have established a trading post in the husk of an abandoned capital ship.</text>

	<text>You arrive and detect signs of battle. A few ships are taking passes at each other near a small station. You don't know if it's a territory issue, a contest or a rite of passage but you decide it's best to stay out of it.</text>
	<text>There's not much at this beacon. Just a few abandoned depots, stripped clean.</text>
	<text>A few freighters pass by but they refuse all communications. Must not want to sully their reputation by talking with foreigners.</text>
	<text>You see a small trading post and ask about refuelling but they respond, "Go away! We don't serve your kind here."</text>
	<text>You see a Zoltan merchant and ask about his wares. He responds, "Sorry, but it took years to gain their trust. I can't be seen communicating with you. I hope you understand." He cuts communications.</text>

	<text>A trader hails you. "The Rockmen are... interesting clients. Perhaps it would be of benefit if I diversify my clientèle... Are you in need of some supplies?"</text>
	<text>It seems a small Rock trading station is operating here. Surprisingly, it claims to be open to ships of all sorts, regardless of their origins.</text>

	<text>The Rock Elders keep a very strict eye on all of their systems. It seems their authoritarian ways have had a very negative effect on the nearby system, because there isn't a single ship roaming about.</text>
	<text>Despite your very presence in this sector being a crime, no Rock ships stop you. A few civilians linger before jumping away, but you are undisturbed.</text>
	<text>It's a miracle to find an empty beacon here, one free from the brutal enforcers who patrol this sector and the ever hostile citizens.</text>
	<text>You can't remember many tales of the Rock Inquisition from Universe 0, but you're sure just a horribly violent war had terrible causalities on the Rock population. This beacon is unnervingly empty of all life, and you can only wonder if it is a consequence of the warmongering of the Elders' pre-Federation years.</text>
	<text>A Rock patrol orbits around the beacon, but luckily they seem rather laid back. They hail you, "we won't tell if you don't either."</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_POPULATED">A Rock settlement lays far in the distance, but they refuse to respond to any hails. This beacon may as well be empty, because nothing can counter the stubbornness of the Rockmen.</text>

	<!--<text>A few refugee ships are preparing for the long journey to another sector. They explain how a number of Lanius military ships surrounded them and began to hack their FTL drives.
