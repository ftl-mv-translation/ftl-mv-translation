<text name="tutorial_start">Welcome to FTL: Multiverse!\n\nThis tutorial will introduce you to the key features introduced by Multiverse.\n\nIt assumes you are already familiar with the basic mechanics of FTL: Faster Than Light.</text>
<text name="tutorial_crew_power">FTL: Multiverse enhances boarding and ship management by adding many crew powers.\n\nYou can activate them by pressing the power button on the right of the crew box, or by selecting your crew and using the power hotkey.\n\nDefault: P</text>
<text name="tutorial_toggle_1">Some of the drones and weapons you will encounter during your runs will have a toggle tag, signified by the presence of a [TYPE] at the end of their name.\n\nThese weapons and drones can be toggled between different states in combat using the toggle [â‡…] menu.\n\nYou can open the toggle menu by either pressing this button or using the hotkey.\n\nDefault: [</text>
<text name="tutorial_toggle_2">This is the toggle menu. Here you can:\n\nChange storage and toggle hotkeys.\n\nToggle shipboard drones to be either automated or controlled manually.\n\nSwitch between different versions of the speed UI that allow you to speed up the game. If you wish to go above speed 2 in the variant 2 UI, you will need to remove the frame cap and disable V-sync in the settings.\n\nToggle instant clone and heal behavior, eliminating all waiting at the end of a fight to restore your crew.\n\nSwitch between the different states of your weapons and drones.\n\nQuit this menu to continue the tutorial.</text>
<text name="tutorial_info_button">Hyperspace provides more detailed information about crew and weapons when hovered. You can toggle this with the information button.</text>
<text name="tutorial_crew_order">You can reorder your crew list holding right-click on a crew member and moving them up or down.</text>
<text name="tutorial_tile_control">Crew control in FTL: Multiverse is tile-based rather than room-based, allowing you to move crew to specific tiles within the same room to better handle boarders or assign a new manning crew.</text>
<text name="tutorial_storage_initial">Multiverse adds a secondary upgrade menu called the storage menu.\n\nClick this button to open it, or use the hotkey.\n\nDefault: ]</text>
<text name="tutorial_storage_main">The storage menu allows you to install upgrades for your ship and crew, as well as track the progress of your current run.\n\nSelect any option for more information.\n\nQuit this menu to continue the tutorial.</text>
<text name="tutorial_storage_mission">In the mission status menu, you can check on the unique crew you have encountered and the unique bosses you have defeated along the way.</text>
<text name="tutorial_storage_system">In the internal upgrade menu, you can install system-specific upgrades that give you an edge in combat.\n\nYou can also install arms (limited to one active at a time) for your ship.</text>
<text name="tutorial_storage_lab">In the laboratory menu, you can apply species-specific upgrades to make your crew better-suited to certain roles.</text>
<text name="tutorial_fight_start">Jump to a new beacon to continue.</text>
<text name="tutorial_fight_check">Before any fight, you will be prompted by a "combat check" window.\n\nHere, you can take emergency actions or activate any combat augment you have.</text>
<text name="tutorial_fight_icon">Enemy ships will often have special properties that may dictate the flow of battle.\n\nYou can check them by hovering over the icons.\n\nDo what you do best and make this pirate regret meeting you.</text>
<text name="tutorial_empty_beacon">Jumping to an already visited empty beacon or choosing not to act on certain events will prompt you with this empty beacon event.\n\nHere, you can choose to repair your hull, interact with unique crew members, use specific augments, or launch a salvage expedition (once per sector) that can yield rewards.</text>
<text name="tutorial_notoriety_change">Some decisions you make during a run might impact your reputation, which will affect the outcome of certain encounters, notably with sector guards. Each friendly faction tracks reputation separately, but alienating someone will usually alienate their friends too!\n\nDestroying a hostile ship does not lead to reputation loss under normal circumstances. Reputation changes here are specific to the context of this tutorial.</text>
<text name="tutorial_map_open">Open the star map to continue.</text>
<text name="tutorial_map_immune_beacon">In FTL: Multiverse, you will often encounter quest beacons with a [!] in their name. These signify that the beacon and the quest within it are 'fleet immune' and will never be overtaken by the fleet.</text>
<text name="tutorial_map_immune_beacon_jump">Jump to the next sector to continue the tutorial.</text>
<text name="tutorial_map_sector_choice">In FTL: Multiverse, sectors containing a [!] in their name are special sectors, containing unique ship unlocks and crew for your mission.\n\nSelect a sector to continue.</text>
<text name="tutorial_map_atlas">Whenever you jump to a new sector you'll be presented with the jump atlas.\n\nHere, you can make use of some of your augments to gain an edge in the next sector.\n\nYou can also read the Federation database on the sector to have an idea on how you might be greeted by the locals.</text>
<text name="tutorial_map_atlas_augment">Sector augments will often have a cost associated with them.</text>
<text name="tutorial_map_atlas_reroute">During your run, you may find coordinates to unique sectors. This is where you can choose to use them.\n\nBe aware that rerouting while jumping to sector 8 will cause you to face the Flagship directly when jumping back from your rerouted sector.</text>
<text name="tutorial_guard">Most sector starting beacons will contain a strong guard affiliated with the sector faction.\n\nDepending on your crew and reputation, this encounter may become an unpleasant one.\n\nDeal with it however you see fit.</text>
<text name="tutorial_end">Congratulations on reaching the end of the FTL: Multiverse tutorial!\n\nThere are many new weapons, crew mechanics and more to explore, so don't hesitate to take your time reading descriptions in your future runs.\n\nGood luck, Renegade!</text>
