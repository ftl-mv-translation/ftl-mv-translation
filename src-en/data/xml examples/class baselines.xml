<!--
THIS IS A LIST OF THE CLASS BASELINES.
This does not define what each class has!!! It is merely a guide on what to balance them around!

Classes are organized into "tiers" based on size which determine what sectors they spawn in. 
There are a few exceptions to this.

Tiers:

TINY - min(-) max(3)
includes: shuttle, interceptor

SMALL - min(-) max(5)
includes: scout, outrider, predator, skirmisher, bombard

MEDIUM - min(-) max(+)
includes: fighter, rigger, corvette, enforcer, instigator

LARGE - min(3) max(+)
includes: bomber, assault, light cruiser, destroyer

MASSIVE - min(5) max(+)
includes: battleship, picket, mothership, frigate

UTILITY - min(2) max(5)
includes: protector, harvester, abductor, strike fighter, tactical fighter, dropship

GENERIC - min(-) max(+)
includes: escort, investigator, transport

ESSENTIAL - only appears in special circumstances
includes: guard, trapper, jailer, station, support

does not include alternative classes!
-->


<!--
notes for other people reading this or kix who is a big forgetful oaf:

this is just a general baseline! Some factions have special gimmicks that require changing!
boarding factions (like mantis or duskbringers) can have teleporters on classes that don't usually have them.
-->
